| **[AIM: Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19769v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem: optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time. Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally, AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.</p></details> | 13pages,7 figures |
| **[LoVR: A Benchmark for Long Video Retrieval in Multimodal Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13928v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at https://github.com/TechNomad-ds/LoVR-benchmark</p></details> |  |
| **[MedM2T: A MultiModal Framework for Time-Aware Modeling with Electronic Health Record and Electrocardiogram Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27321v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and (iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction; an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at https://github.com/DHLab-TSENG/MedM2T.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint version of the manuscript has been submitted to the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI) for review.

| **[Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning for Robust Multimodal Fusion under Imbalance and Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26289v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning faces two major challenges: modality imbalance and data noise, which significantly affect the robustness and generalization ability of models. Existing methods achieve modality balance by suppressing dominant modalities, but they neglect the inherent differences in the information value between modalities, potentially leading to convergence to suboptimal solutions. This paper proposes an innovative modality compression paradigm, Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning (CAL), which aims to enhance the contribution of high-contribution modalities while compressing weak modalities to increase their contribution, allowing both to improve the performance of multimodal information fusion. CAL is based on a modality contribution metric W^m combining the information quantity I(m) and confidence D(m), and it designs an asymmetric gradient acceleration mechanism and a contribution-aware Asymmetric Information Bottleneck (AIB) compression mechanism. The former accelerates the gradient update of modalities, while the latter dynamically compresses the noise of low-contribution modalities. On five benchmark datasets, including emotion recognition, scene recognition, and event localization tasks, CAL has shown outstanding performance in imbalanced fusion tasks and noise robustness tests. On CREMA-D, KS, and AVE, CAL achieves 79.30%, 74.82%, and 74.21% accuracy, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model ARL. In high-noise robustness tests, CAL also achieved leading performance under various attack strategies on the MVSA-Single and NYUD2 datasets. These results validate the significant advantages of CAL in modality imbalance and noise interference. CAL, as a flexible and efficient framework, is easy to transfer to other tasks and has broad adaptability and potential application prospects.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoralCLIP: Contrastive Alignment of Vision-and-Language Representations with Moral Foundations Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05696v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version: corresponds to the ACM MM '25 published paper and includes full appendix material</p></details> |
| **[Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/Kwen-Chen/SPECS-VL</p></details> |
| **[H3M-SSMoEs: Hypergraph-based Multimodal Learning with LLM Reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25091v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting effective risk control.

| **[Modality-Aware SAM: Sharpness-Aware-Minimization Driven Gradient Modulation for Harmonized Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24919v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM), a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality, and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynCIM: Dynamic Curriculum for Imbalanced Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06456v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning integrates complementary information from diverse modalities to enhance the decision-making process. However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Raymond-Qiancx/DynCIM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning via Cross-Modal Proxy Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17823v4)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality without requiring explicit modality generation or auxiliary networks. To efficiently learn these approximations with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/CSIPlab/Cross-Modal-Proxy-Tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 Pa...</summary><p>28 Pages, 13 Figures, 11 Tables.

| **[Amplifying Prominent Representations in Multimodal Learning via Variational Dirichlet Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20736v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

| **[Multimodal Negative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20877v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm: "Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities' target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities, particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach against competing methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/BaoquanGong/Multimodal-Negative-Learning.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[With Limited Data for Multimodal Alignment, Let the STRUCTURE Guide You](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16895v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment, including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Multimodal Learning from the Perspective of Mitigating Classification Ability Disproportion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20120v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning (MML) is significantly constrained by modality imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in practice. While existing approaches primarily focus on balancing the learning of different modalities to address this issue, they fundamentally overlook the inherent disproportion in model classification ability, which serves as the primary cause of this phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities by incorporating the principle of boosting. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors. Subsequently, we introduce an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of the weak modality. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of the cross-modal gap function, ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed boosting scheme. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal learning baselines.

| **[FrogDeepSDM: Improving Frog Counting and Occurrence Prediction Using Multimodal Data and Pseudo-Absence Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19305v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura) by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the "EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification, achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable biodiversity monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixelWorld: How Far Are We from Perceiving Everything as Pixels?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19339v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent agentic language models increasingly need to interact with real-world environments that contain tightly intertwined visual and textual information, often through raw camera pixels rather than separately processed images and tokenized text. This shift highlights the need for a unified perception paradigm. To investigate this idea, we explore Perceive Everything as Pixels (PEAP) and introduce PixelWorld, a benchmark that renders natural-language, tabular, mathematical, and diagrammatic inputs into a shared pixel space. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that PEAP achieves comparable performance to token-based approaches on semantic understanding tasks, suggesting that vision transformers can partially capture global textual semantics without explicit tokenization. In contrast, reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and code show notable performance degradation, although Chain-of-Thought prompting helps mitigate this gap by compensating for missing symbolic structure. We further find that when visual and textual information are closely integrated, representing everything as pixels simplifies preprocessing and avoids cross-modal misalignment. PixelWorld thus provides a systematic and practical framework for evaluating unified vision--language models and facilitates further exploration of pixel-based multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Inductive, Cross-Domain, and Multimodal Learning for Robust and Generalizable Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21812v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have long been built upon the modeling of interactions between users and items, while recent studies have sought to broaden this paradigm by generalizing to new users and items, incorporating diverse information sources, and transferring knowledge across domains. Nevertheless, these efforts have largely focused on individual aspects, hindering their ability to tackle the complex recommendation scenarios that arise in daily consumptions across diverse domains. In this paper, we present MICRec, a unified framework that fuses inductive modeling, multimodal guidance, and cross-domain transfer to capture user contexts and latent preferences in heterogeneous and incomplete real-world data. Moving beyond the inductive backbone of INMO, our model refines expressive representations through modality-based aggregation and alleviates data sparsity by leveraging overlapping users as anchors across domains, thereby enabling robust and generalizable recommendation. Experiments show that MICRec outperforms 12 baselines, with notable gains in domains with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, and 4 tables.

However, training of multimodal networks is typically hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance, hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal learning on improving model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'25).

| **[Graph4MM: Weaving Multimodal Learning with Structural Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16990v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references. Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific, we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion. Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines, achieving a 6.93% average improvement.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14807v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing body of work in specialized visualization retrieval systems, a systematic approach to understanding visualization similarity remains absent. We introduce the Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval (Safire), a conceptual model that frames visualization similarity along two dimensions: comparison criteria and representation modalities. Comparison criteria identify the aspects that make visualizations similar, which we divide into primary facets (data, visual encoding, interaction, style, metadata) and derived properties (data-centric and human-centric measures). Safire connects what to compare with how comparisons are executed through representation modalities. We categorize existing representation approaches into four groups based on their levels of information content and visualization determinism: raster image, vector image, specification, and natural language description, together guiding what is computable and comparable. We analyze several visualization retrieval systems using Safire to demonstrate its practical value in clarifying similarity considerations. Our findings reveal how particular criteria and modalities align across different use cases. Notably, the choice of representation modality is not only an implementation detail but also an important decision that shapes retrieval capabilities and limitations. Based on our analysis, we provide recommendations and discuss broader implications for multimodal learning, AI applications, and visualization reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |

However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

| **[Towards Relaxed Multimodal Inputs for Gait-based Parkinson's Disease Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15748v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years, particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques. Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources. However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced according to the capabilities of each modality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some Insights in Balanced Multimodal Learning</p></details> |

We propose a lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature, humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37 training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO. Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau} =0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9: 61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con- servation decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Criteria for Knowledge Distillation in Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13182v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer "teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video, audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving the performance of weaker modalities.</p></details> |  |

Recent multimodal learning integrates text and images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation. However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Experimental results show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs on IL3D significantly improves generalization and surpasses the performance of SFT on other datasets. IL3D offers flexible multimodal data export capabilities, including point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, multiview images, depth maps, normal maps, and semantic masks, enabling seamless adaptation to various visual tasks. As a versatile and robust resource, IL3D significantly advances research in 3D scene generation and embodied intelligence, by providing high-fidelity scene data to support environment perception tasks of embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main paper; 15 pages references and appendix</p></details> |

Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers 164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director, orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos.

Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing multimodal learning systems for improved scalability, robustness, and generalizability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Jigsaw-R1: A Study of Rule-based Visual Reinforcement Learning with Jigsaw Puzzles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23590v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Video-based monitoring, combined with deep learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6 dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking, standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows. Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[Lyapunov-Stable Adaptive Control for Multimodal Concept Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15944v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance. Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously adapting multimodal learning systems.</p></details> |  |

Within the constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3) auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision, favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words. While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the EMNLP 2025 BabyLM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Provably Robust Adaptation for Language-Empowered Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08659v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP, have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification (\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | 19 pages |

The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

We center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.

However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions, objects, and events directly observable within individual frames or short clips. In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, relationships across discontinuous frames with disjoint visual contexts. Humans naturally excel at such implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context to construct coherent narratives. Yet current benchmarks fail to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test VideoQA models on human-like implicit reasoning. ImplicitQA comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs drawn from 1K high-quality creative video clips covering 15 genres across 7 decades of content. Questions are systematically categorized into nine key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors, validated through multiple annotators, and benchmarked against human performance to ensure high quality. Our extensive evaluations on 11 leading VideoQA models reveals consistent and significant performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches based on phones often rely on costly resources such as grapheme-to-phoneme converters (G2Ps) and struggle to generalize to languages with ambiguous phoneme boundaries due to training instability. In this paper, we address both challenges by introducing a syllable-level UASR framework based on masked language modeling, which avoids the need for G2P and the instability of GAN-based methods. Our approach achieves up to a 40\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) on LibriSpeech and generalizes effectively to Mandarin, a language that has remained particularly difficult for prior methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, UAVs are distributed throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems, enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling, power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance under different data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |

Yet, current training methods often underperform due to modality competition, a phenomenon where modalities contend for training resources leaving some underoptimized. This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.

Recent advances in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception, encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics and geometry.

However, existing multimodal learning models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances. The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness learning methods.</p></details> | 10 Pages |

While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals. However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge, thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines in addressing modality imbalance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy. This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133 textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing aquatic science.</p></details> | 3 figures 8 tables |
| **[A TRIANGLE Enables Multimodal Alignment Beyond Cosine Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24734v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales. Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, modalities observed in the source environment may differ from the modalities observed in the target environment due to multiple factors, including cost, hardware failure, or the perceived informativeness of a given modality. This shift in missingness between the source and target environment has not been carefully studied. Naive estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in the target environment. We formalize the problem of missingness, demonstrate its ubiquity, and show that the subsequent distribution shift results in bias when the missingness process is not explicitly accounted for. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multimodal Active Learning: Efficient Learning with Limited Paired Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03247v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) is a principled strategy to reduce annotation cost in data-hungry deep learning. However, existing AL algorithms focus almost exclusively on unimodal data, overlooking the substantial annotation burden in multimodal learning. We introduce the first framework for multimodal active learning with unaligned data, where the learner must actively acquire cross-modal alignments rather than labels on pre-aligned pairs. This setting captures the practical bottleneck in modern multimodal pipelines such as CLIP and SigLIP, where unimodal features are easy to obtain but high-quality alignment is costly. We develop a new algorithm that combines uncertainty and diversity principles in a modality-aware design, achieves linear-time acquisition, and applies seamlessly to both pool-based and streaming-based settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces multimodal annotation cost while preserving performance; for instance, on the ColorSwap dataset it cuts annotation requirements by up to $40\%$ without loss in accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal AI predicts clinical outcomes of drug combinations from preclinical data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02781v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations, reducing late-stage clinical failures, and accelerating the development of precision therapies. Current AI models rely on structural or target-based features but fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically relevant predictions. Here, we introduce Madrigal, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug-combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21,842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. Madrigal uses an attention bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference, a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions, and ablations show both modality alignment and multimodality are necessary. It captures transporter-mediated interactions and aligns with head-to-head clinical trial differences for neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and hypoglycemia. In type 2 diabetes and MASH, Madrigal supports polypharmacy decisions and prioritizes resmetirom among safer candidates. Extending to personalization, Madrigal improves patient-level adverse-event prediction in a longitudinal EHR cohort and an independent oncology cohort, and predicts ex vivo efficacy in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models. Madrigal links preclinical multimodal readouts to safety risks of drug combinations and offers a generalizable foundation for safer combination design.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |

In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not available, content-based recommender systems use side information instead. Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities. Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch alternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six accuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the recommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their hyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios. We quantitatively and qualitatively study the effects of these different aspects on bridging the modality gap. Our results show that single-branch networks achieve competitive performance in warm-start scenarios and are significantly better in missing modality settings. Moreover, our approach leads to closer proximity of an item's modalities in the embedding space. Our full experimental setup is available at https://github.com/hcai-mms/single-branch-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/medical-modality-dropout.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

We present ClassMind, an AI-driven classroom observation system that integrates generative AI and multimodal learning to analyze classroom artifacts (e.g., class recordings) and deliver timely, personalized feedback aligned with pedagogical practices. At its core is AVA-Align, an agent framework that analyzes long classroom video recordings to generate temporally precise, best-practice-aligned feedback to support teacher reflection and improvement. Our three-phase study involved participatory co-design with educators, development of a full-stack system, and field testing with teachers at different stages of practice. Teachers highlighted the system's usefulness, ease of use, and novelty, while also raising concerns about privacy and the role of human judgment, motivating deeper exploration of future human--AI coaching partnerships. This work illustrates how multimodal AI can scale expert coaching and advance teacher development.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods struggle to fully leverage the textual modality, relying on supervised pretrained models, which limits semantic extraction in unsupervised robotic environments, particularly with significant modality loss. These methods also tend to be computationally intensive, leading to high resource consumption in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi Modal Mamba Enhanced Transformer (M3ET), a lightweight model designed for efficient multimodal learning, particularly on mobile platforms. By incorporating the Mamba module and a semantic-based adaptive attention mechanism, M3ET optimizes feature fusion, alignment, and modality reconstruction. Our experiments show that M3ET improves cross-task performance, with a 2.3 times increase in pretraining inference speed. In particular, the core VQA task accuracy of M3ET remains at 0.74, while the model's parameter count is reduced by 0.67. Although performance on the EQA task is limited, M3ET's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Trainee Action Recognition through Interaction Analysis in CCATT Mixed-Reality Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17888v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress. Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events, thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation, we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to ICASSP</p></details> |

Such plateauing underlines a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference, without sacrificing performance. This is particularly pressing for multimodal learning, where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens alongside language data often limits the practical viability of these systems. In parallel, advances in representation learning and interpretability have deepened our understanding of how such models process and encode information. Notably, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large pretrained models. Interestingly, this aligns with our own observations that models naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper stages of computation. Building on this, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities: 1) LLaVA \& BLIP for vision, 2) LTU for audio, and 3) MoLCA for molecular data, indicate that our method reduces computational costs during both training and inference, while at the very least, preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines. Our work has important implications for scaling and composing pretrained models in a resource-efficient manner.</p></details> |  |

In this contribution, we propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. We further identify that image-based 3D reconstruction and albedo estimation (Shape and Albedo from Shading) of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal learning to solve Shape and Albedo from Shading and provide a new approach for large-scale planetary 3D reconstruction. Adding more input modalities in the future will further improve the results and enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 48pages |

This need arises from the widespread influence and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV (VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in combating misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Words: Enhancing Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition with Non-Verbal Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15540v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition, which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically, low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction at both local and global representations of image information. Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding, 0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis.

Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM) encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR, a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone. LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines, handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further research in medical image-text representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 2 figures, under review</p></details> |

Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD strategy we proposed.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations, including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment. Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1) descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large. All translated captions and metadata (language, CLIP score, etc.) are available on HuggingFace.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight paper</p></details> |

While these methods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain robustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation and adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to enhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of multimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In this study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on multimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware features, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file representations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We conduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in combination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the dynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98% accuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the proposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and 98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios. Our findings highlight the benefits of multimodal fusion in improving both detection accuracy and robustness against evolving Android malware threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Filling the Gaps: A Multitask Hybrid Multiscale Generative Framework for Missing Modality in Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11102v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models' operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet, outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam).

Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods.

| **[Advancing Few-Shot Pediatric Arrhythmia Classification with a Novel Contrastive Loss and Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19315v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset, including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64, +15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening, pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and congenital heart disease populations.</p></details> | 12pages, 10 figures |

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e, scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1) imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding. Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning in Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08040v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Debiasing Medical Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05615v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from each modality and the inter-modality interaction information. Existing strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme. UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance improvement in multimodal learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03837v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection, formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, submitted to IUI2026</p></details> |

We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IJCAI 2025 in Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

For example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals, using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone. Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has broad applicability in additive manufacturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning, which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning, which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities. Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58% respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under different missing types and rates.

Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at: https://github.com/peng-lab/hescape</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities. Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space. However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions; and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal representations under each relation context. The training objective combines inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19525v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose ConfSMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture by taking the opinion of experts and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, ConfSMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth signal. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. The proposed method is evaluated on four different real world dataset with three distinct experiment settings to conduct comprehensive analysis of ConfSMoE on resistance to missing modality and the impacts of proposed gating mechanism.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However, existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics. Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings.

| **[A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal representations, especially when these representations are obtained through explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities. To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[MMiC: Mitigating Modality Incompleteness in Clustered Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06911v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning on Multimodal Analysis of Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14926v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.</p></details> | 34 pages |

In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result, modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture. Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

While Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN) leverage modularity maximization and collapse regularization to ensure structural separation, they lack explicit mechanisms for feature-space separation, assignment dispersion, and assignment-confidence control. We address this limitation by proposing Deep Modularity Networks with Diversity-Preserving Regularization (DMoN-DPR), which introduces three novel regularization terms: distance-based for inter-cluster separation, variance-based for per-cluster assignment dispersion, and an assignment-entropy penalty with a small positive weight, encouraging more confident assignments gradually. Our method significantly enhances label-based clustering metrics on feature-rich benchmark datasets (paired two-tailed t-test, $p\leq0.05$), demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating diversity-preserving regularizations in creating meaningful and interpretable clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Graph Machine Learning (NPGML)</p></details> |

This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability.

However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</p></details> |  |

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

While existing methods often utilize attention mechanisms or graph convolutional networks to model visual representations, their performance is still constrained by two critical limitations: the inability to learn discriminative semantic-aware features, and the lack of fine-grained alignment between visual representations and label embeddings. To tackle these issues in a unified framework, this paper proposes a novel approach named Semantic-aware representation learning via Conditional Transport for Multi-Label Image Classification (SCT). The proposed method introduces a semantic-related feature learning module that extracts discriminative label-specific features by emphasizing semantic relevance and interaction, along with a conditional transport-based alignment mechanism that enables precise visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark datasets, VOC2007 and MS-COCO, validate the effectiveness of SCT and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |

These limitations restrict their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets, nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Demystifying the Roles of LLM Layers in Retrieval, Knowledge, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02091v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

Many such foundation models adopt approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches for how to most effectively leverage remotely sensed data. This paper examines these approaches, along with their roots in the computer vision field. This is done to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls, while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We first examine single-sensor remote foundation models to introduce concepts and provide context, and then place emphasis on incorporating the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations into foundation models. In particular, we explore the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, submitted to ACM SigSpatial, currently under peer review.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory analysis with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. When latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw. The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small, imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision. Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Effect of Domain Generalization Techniques in Low Resource Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27512v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with varying gains across languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Byzantine Resilient Federated Multi-Task Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19209v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose BR-MTRL, a Byzantine-resilient multi-task representation learning framework that handles faulty or malicious agents. Our approach leverages representation learning through a shared neural network model, where all clients share fixed layers, except for a client-specific final layer. This structure captures shared features among clients while enabling individual adaptation, making it a promising approach for leveraging client data and computational power in heterogeneous federated settings to learn personalized models. To learn the model, we employ an alternating gradient descent strategy: each client optimizes its local model, updates its final layer, and sends estimates of the shared representation to a central server for aggregation. To defend against Byzantine agents, we employ two robust aggregation methods for client-server communication, Geometric Median and Krum. Our method enables personalized learning while maintaining resilience in distributed settings. We implemented the proposed algorithm in a federated testbed built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and compared its performance with various benchmark algorithms and their variations. Through experiments using real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST, we demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and its transferability to new unseen clients with limited data, even in the presence of Byzantine adversaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Neural Graph Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27474v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods.

While model-agnostic frameworks such as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely align with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after. Counterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of which circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome, may be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate counterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features are most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of counterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning, exploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model itself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the explanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are crossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this method on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit dataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more useful than Shapley values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at XAI-FIN-2025: International Joint Workshop on Explainable AI in Finance: Achieving Trustworthy Financial Decision-Making; November 15, 2025; Singapore</p></details> |
| **[Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings. Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Functional embeddings enable Aggregation of multi-area SEEG recordings over subjects and sessions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27090v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference, but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i) learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear, region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding. Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models. Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

| **[CARE: Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16988v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTok-Audio: A Unified Audio Generation Framework via Generative Modeling on Discrete Codec Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26372v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text, image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here: https://alibaba.github.io/unified-audio.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Understanding Hardness of Vision-Language Compositionality from A Token-level Causal Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26302v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential, language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text, proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially, token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReaKase-8B: Legal Case Retrieval via Knowledge and Reasoning Representations with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26178v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another, mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems. The code has been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/ReaKase-8B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Molecule and Textual Descriptions via Substructure-aware Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26157v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information. However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks, highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text learning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 (main) |

However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology, thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data, while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of "data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.</p></details> | 9 pages |

A key challenge is to model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains when incorporated into the Consurv framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 workshop Learning from Time Series for Health (TS4H)</p></details> |

Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

| **[Dynamic Traceback Learning for Medical Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13267v4)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated medical report generation has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the workload associated with time-consuming medical reporting. Recent generative representation learning methods have shown promise in integrating vision and language modalities for medical report generation. However, when trained end-to-end and applied directly to medical image-to-text generation, they face two significant challenges: i) difficulty in accurately capturing subtle yet crucial pathological details, and ii) reliance on both visual and textual inputs during inference, leading to performance degradation in zero-shot inference when only images are available. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal dynamic traceback learning framework (DTrace). Specifically, we introduce a traceback mechanism to supervise the semantic validity of generated content and a dynamic learning strategy to adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling text generation without strong reliance on the input from both modalities during inference. The learning of cross-modal knowledge is enhanced by supervising the model to recover masked semantic information from a complementary counterpart. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that the proposed DTrace framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Quality-Aware Prototype Memory for Face Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07734v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prototype Memory is a powerful model for face representation learning. It enables training face recognition models on datasets of any size by generating prototypes (classifier weights) on the fly and efficiently utilizing them. Prototype Memory demonstrated strong results in many face recognition benchmarks. However, the algorithm of prototype generation, used in it, is prone to the problems of imperfectly calculated prototypes in case of low-quality or poorly recognizable faces in the images, selected for the prototype creation. All images of the same person presented in the mini-batch are used with equal weights, and the resulting averaged prototype can be contaminated by imperfect embeddings of low-quality face images. This may lead to misleading training signals and degrade the performance of the trained models. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to improve Prototype Memory with quality-aware prototype generation. Quality-Aware Prototype Memory uses different weights for images of different quality in the process of prototype generation. With this improvement, prototypes receive more informative signals from high-quality images and are less affected by low-quality ones. We propose and compare several methods of quality estimation and usage, perform extensive experiments on the different face recognition benchmarks and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model compared to the basic version of Prototype Memory.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we demonstrate why InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but from the learning of structured density ratios.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios.

Current deep learning methods, despite their effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA (Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction). Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection systems without compromising accuracy.

In beat and downbeat tracking, for instance, different listeners may adopt various rhythmic interpretations, none of which would necessarily be incorrect. To address this, we propose a contrastive self-supervised pre-training approach that leverages multiple hypotheses about possible positive samples in the data. Our model is trained to learn representations compatible with different such hypotheses, which are selected with a knowledge-based scoring function to retain the most plausible ones. When fine-tuned on labeled data, our model outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks, showcasing the advantages of integrating domain knowledge with multi-hypothesis selection in music representation learning in particular.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.</p></details> |  |

We propose IB-Inspired Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization. Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior.

| **[Improving time series estimation and prediction via transfer learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25236v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many time series in the literature with high dimension yet limited sample sizes, such as macroeconomic variables, and it is almost impossible to obtain efficient estimation and accurate prediction by using the corresponding datasets themselves. This paper fills the gap by introducing a novel representation-based transfer learning framework for vector autoregressive models, and information from related source datasets with rich observations can be leveraged to enhance estimation efficiency through representation learning. A two-stage regularized estimation procedure is proposed with well established non-asymptotic properties, and algorithms with alternating updates are suggested to search for the estimates. Our transfer learning framework can handle time series with varying sample sizes and asynchronous starting and/or ending time points, thereby offering remarkable flexibility in integrating information from diverse datasets. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology, and its usefulness is demonstrated by an empirical analysis on 20 macroeconomic variables from Japan and another nine countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair Graph Representations with Multi-view Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25096v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases, propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreak Transferability Emerges from Shared Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12913v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak transferability is the surprising phenomenon when an adversarial attack compromising one model also elicits harmful responses from other models. Despite widespread demonstrations, there is little consensus on why transfer is possible: is it a quirk of safety training, an artifact of model families, or a more fundamental property of representation learning? We present evidence that transferability emerges from shared representations rather than incidental flaws. Across 20 open-weight models and 33 jailbreak attacks, we find two factors that systematically shape transfer: (1) representational similarity under benign prompts, and (2) the strength of the jailbreak on the source model. To move beyond correlation, we show that deliberately increasing similarity through benign only distillation causally increases transfer. Our qualitative analyses reveal systematic transferability patterns across different types of jailbreaks. For example, persona-style jailbreaks transfer far more often than cipher-based prompts, consistent with the idea that natural-language attacks exploit models' shared representation space, whereas cipher-based attacks rely on idiosyncratic quirks that do not generalize. Together, these results reframe jailbreak transfer as a consequence of representation alignment rather than a fragile byproduct of safety training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eigenfunction Extraction for Ordered Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24672v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work, we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms, low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection, enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional representations.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller. HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health.</p></details> |  |

PeL directly targets label-free perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual quality.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize 2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate, generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability across diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The emerged codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes, such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 accepted</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches.

However, how these approaches can complement each other within a unified framework remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a multi-view learning framework that integrates contrastive principles into a generative pipeline to capture sound source and device information. Our method encodes compressed audio latents into view-specific and view-common subspaces, guided by two self-supervised objectives: contrastive learning for targeted information flow between subspaces, and reconstruction for overall information preservation. We evaluate our method on an urban sound sensor network dataset for sound source and sensor classification, demonstrating improved downstream performance over traditional SSL techniques. Additionally, we investigate the model's potential to disentangle environmental sound attributes within the structured latent space under varied training configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DCASE 2025 Workshop. 4+1 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Debiasing Reward Models by Representation Learning with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23751v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length, discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that, interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields more robust reward models.</p></details> |  |

While previous work has made great efforts to model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by 4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding foundation model in computational advertising.</p></details> | 12 pages, KDD 2025 |

This technique is critical in drug discovery and has greatly advanced with recent improvements in computer vision. Inspired by recent developments in non-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), this paper provides an initial exploration into training a generalizable feature extractor for cell images using such methods. However, there are two major challenges: 1) Unlike typical scenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling often involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively fuse all available information; and 2) There is a large difference between the distributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation process in existing SSL methods to fail. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised framework with local aggregation to improve cross-site consistency of cell representations. We introduce specialized data augmentation and representation post-processing methods tailored to cell images, which effectively address the issues mentioned above and result in a robust feature extractor. With these improvements, the proposed framework won the Cell Line Transferability challenge at CVPR 2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Computer Vision for Drug Discovery</p></details> |

In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. This work presents HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder), an alternative method to solve tasks involving higher-order interactions \emph{without message passing}. Instead, HOPSE breaks \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships using a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the representation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes results in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP. The experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP methods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Novel Framework for Multi-Modal Protein Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23273v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts (e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding (DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms. First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method, where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically, DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains 0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing protein function prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including 2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software, and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software code mining.</p></details> |  |

This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks, showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open challenges. CTNNs address this gap by formulating model design in the language of copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core challenges in representation learning, such as long-range dependencies, oversmoothing, heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized sensitivity.

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations.

Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix, PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods.

Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness. We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum, average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Therefore, long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However, existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove the "bad" while keep the "good".

However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

Existing root cause analysis (RCA) approaches, even with multi-modal fusion of logs, traces, and metrics, remain limited in capturing dynamic behaviors and shifting service relationships. Three critical challenges persist: (i) inadequate modeling of cascading fault propagation, (ii) vulnerability to noise interference and concept drift in normal service behavior, and (iii) over-reliance on service deviation intensity that obscures true root causes. To address these challenges, we propose DynaCausal, a dynamic causality-aware framework for RCA in distributed microservice systems. DynaCausal unifies multi-modal dynamic signals to capture time-varying spatio-temporal dependencies through interaction-aware representation learning. It further introduces a dynamic contrastive mechanism to disentangle true fault indicators from contextual noise and adopts a causal-prioritized pairwise ranking objective to explicitly optimize causal attribution. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that DynaCausal consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, attaining an average AC@1 of 0.63 with absolute gains from 0.25 to 0.46, and delivering both accurate and interpretable diagnoses in highly dynamic microservice environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Sample-Efficient Transfer Learning Conditional Diffusion Models via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04491v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various applications, they require abundant data to train from scratch, which is often infeasible in practice. To address this issue, transfer learning has emerged as an essential paradigm in small data regimes. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of transfer learning conditional diffusion models remain unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the sample efficiency of transfer learning conditional diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. Inspired by practical training procedures, we assume that there exists a low-dimensional representation of conditions shared across all tasks. Our analysis shows that with a well-learned representation from source tasks, the samplecomplexity of target tasks can be reduced substantially. In addition, we investigate the practical implications of our theoretical results in several real-world applications of conditional diffusion models. Numerical experiments are also conducted to verify our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Search Neural Networks for Efficient and Expressive Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22520v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to 16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive framework for learning on sparse graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NEURI...</summary><p>NEURIPS 2025; version with full appendix</p></details> |

Given the noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties, graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation, RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |
| **[Beyond Augmentation: Leveraging Inter-Instance Relation in Self-Supervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22322v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances. Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed graph based mechanism.

| **[IndiSeek learns information-guided disentangled representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21584v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning disentangled representations is a fundamental task in multi-modal learning. In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic-Aware Spatio-temporal Representation Learning for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09049v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic MRI reconstruction, one of inverse problems, has seen a surge by the use of deep learning techniques. Especially, the practical difficulty of obtaining ground truth data has led to the emergence of unsupervised learning approaches. A recent promising method among them is implicit neural representation (INR), which defines the data as a continuous function that maps coordinate values to the corresponding signal values. This allows for filling in missing information only with incomplete measurements and solving the inverse problem effectively. Nevertheless, previous works incorporating this method have faced drawbacks such as long optimization time and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose Dynamic-Aware INR (DA-INR), an INR-based model for dynamic MRI reconstruction that captures the spatial and temporal continuity of dynamic MRI data in the image domain and explicitly incorporates the temporal redundancy of the data into the model structure. As a result, DA-INR outperforms other models in reconstruction quality even at extreme undersampling ratios while significantly reducing optimization time and requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | MICCAI2025 |
| **[Unifying Search and Recommendation with Dual-View Representation Learning in a Generative Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06714v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems and search engines serve as foundational elements of online platforms, with the former delivering information proactively and the latter enabling users to seek information actively. Unifying both tasks in a shared model is promising since it can enhance user modeling and item understanding. Previous approaches mainly follow a discriminative paradigm, utilizing shared encoders to process input features and task-specific heads to perform each task. However, this paradigm encounters two key challenges: gradient conflict and manual design complexity. From the information theory perspective, these challenges potentially both stem from the same issue -- low mutual information between the input features and task-specific outputs during the optimization process. To tackle these issues, we propose GenSR, a novel generative paradigm for unifying search and recommendation (S&R), which leverages task-specific prompts to partition the model's parameter space into subspaces, thereby enhancing mutual information. To construct effective subspaces for each task, GenSR first prepares informative representations for each subspace and then optimizes both subspaces in one unified model. Specifically, GenSR consists of two main modules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models collaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item representations; and (2) S&R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning together with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across S&R tasks. Our work introduces a new generative paradigm compared with previous discriminative methods and establishes its superiority from the mutual information perspective.</p></details> |  |

We propose MAGIC-Flow, a conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels, MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains, with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.</p></details> |  |

While meta-reinforcement learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025</p></details> |

Recent work has explored training neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the \emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and scalable tools for machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Causal Climate Emulation with Bayesian Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09891v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physically-based causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a novel approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.</p></details> | 37 pages, 26 figures |

We propose MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion, we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a 27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular representation.

This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Fairness-Performance Pareto Front Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17643v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a well known intrinsic trade-off between the fairness of a representation and the performance of classifiers derived from the representation. Due to the complexity of optimisation algorithms in most modern representation learning approaches, for a given method it may be non-trivial to decide whether the obtained fairness-performance curve of the method is optimal, i.e., whether it is close to the true Pareto front for these quantities for the underlying data distribution. In this paper we propose a new method to compute the optimal Pareto front, which does not require the training of complex representation models. We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods. Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared. We experimentally evaluate the approach on a number of real world benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, contain link to package.

To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations (ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Disentangled Representation Learning via Modular Compositional Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21402v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

| **[Dataset Condensation with Color Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01139v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues.

However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Surveys and overviews; Natural language processing; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Graph algorithms</p></details> |

The main methodological challenge in this setting is representing these high-dimensional treatments without losing their semantic meaning or rendering analysis intractable. Here, we address this problem by focusing on learning low-dimensional representations that capture the underlying structure of such treatments. These representations enable downstream applications such as guiding generative models to produce meaningful treatment variants and facilitating adaptive assignment in online experiments. We propose double kernel representation learning, which models the causal effect through the inner product of kernel-based representations of treatments and user covariates. We develop an alternating-minimization algorithm that learns these representations efficiently from data and provides convergence guarantees under a low-rank factor model. As an application of this framework, we introduce an adaptive design strategy for online experimentation and demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |

Ensuring fairness guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with *controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air **R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)* framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[L^2M^3OF: A Large Language Multimodal Model for Metal-Organic Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20976v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage. Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly. L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

Drawing on a variety of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features, through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover, a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic understanding in low-resource languages.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[ROPES: Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based Causal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20884v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically, this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background, and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated (intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical testbed for CRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this paper appeared at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Embodied World Models for Decision Making</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Structural and Semantic Signals in Text-Attributed Graphs with BiGTex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12474v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Amplifying Prominent Representations in Multimodal Learning via Variational Dirichlet Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20736v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

| **[Structured Spectral Graph Representation Learning for Multi-label Abnormality Analysis from 3D CT Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10779v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work of academic research, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

We bypass loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the interactive loop, and the memory system.

While direct optimization of MI via its definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information. Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning in MI-based representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-efficient Learning of Concepts with Theoretical Guarantees: from Data to Concepts without Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06536v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is a vital part of many real-world systems, but several concerns remain about the lack of interpretability, explainability and robustness of black-box AI systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) address some of these challenges by learning interpretable concepts from high-dimensional data, e.g. images, which are used to predict labels. An important issue in CBMs are spurious correlation between concepts, which effectively lead to learning "wrong" concepts. Current mitigating strategies have strong assumptions, e.g., they assume that the concepts are statistically independent of each other, or require substantial interaction in terms of both interventions and labels provided by annotators. In this paper, we describe a framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the learned concepts and on the number of required labels, without requiring any interventions. Our framework leverages causal representation learning (CRL) methods to learn latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations in a unsupervised way, and then learns to align these variables with interpretable concepts with few concept labels. We propose a linear and a non-parametric estimator for this mapping, providing a finite-sample high probability result in the linear case and an asymptotic consistency result for the non-parametric estimator. We evaluate our framework in synthetic and image benchmarks, showing that the learned concepts have less impurities and are often more accurate than other CBMs, even in settings with strong correlations between concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 23 figures, 12 Tables, Published</p></details> |

| **[Geodesic Synthetic Control Methods for Random Objects and Functional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00331v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a geodesic synthetic control method for causal inference that extends existing synthetic control methods to scenarios where outcomes are elements in a geodesic metric space rather than scalars. Examples of such outcomes include distributions, compositions, networks, trees and functional data, among other data types that can be viewed as elements of a geodesic metric space given a suitable metric. We extend this further to geodesic synthetic difference-in-differences that builds on the established synthetic difference-in-differences for Euclidean outcomes. This estimator generalizes both the geodesic synthetic control method and a previously proposed geodesic difference-in-differences method and exhibits a double robustness property. The proposed geodesic synthetic control method is illustrated through comprehensive simulation studies and applications to the employment composition changes following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, and the impact of abortion liberalization policy on fertility patterns in East Germany. We illustrate the proposed geodesic synthetic difference-in-differences by studying the consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse on age-at-death distributions for males and females.</p></details> | 58 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Representation-Level Counterfactual Calibration for Debiased Zero-Shot Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26466v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores. Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing the Effects of Environmental Exposures on Social Mobility: Bayesian Semi-parametrics for Principal Stratification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00311v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the causal effects of air pollution exposures on social mobility is attracting increasing attention. At the same time, education is widely recognized as a key driver of social mobility. However, the causal pathways linking fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, educational attainment, and social mobility remain largely unexplored. To address this, we adopt the principal stratification approach, which rigorously defines causal effects when a post-treatment variable--educational attainment--is affected by exposure--PM2.5--and may, in turn, affect the primary outcome--social mobility. To estimate the causal effects, we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric method leveraging infinite mixtures for modeling the primary outcome. The proposed method (i) allows flexible modeling of the distribution of the primary potential outcomes, (ii) improves the accuracy of counterfactual imputation--a fundamental problem in causal inference framework--, and (iii) enables the characterization of treatment effects across different values of the post-treatment variable. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology through a Monte Carlo simulation study, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches. Finally, we apply our method to a national dataset of 3,009 counties in the United States to estimate the causal effect of PM2.5 on social mobility, taking into account educational attainment as a post-treatment variable. Our findings indicate that in counties where higher PM2.5 exposure significantly reduces educational attainment social mobility decreases by approximately 5% compared to counties with lower PM2.5 exposure. We also find that in counties where exposure to PM2.5 does not affect educational attainment, social mobility is reduced by approximately 2% hinting at the possibility of further, yet unexplored, pathways connecting air pollution and social mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Nonparametrics for Principal Stratification with Continuous Post-Treatment Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17669v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Principal stratification provides a causal inference framework for investigating treatment effects in the presence of a post-treatment variable. Principal strata play a key role in characterizing the treatment effect by identifying groups of units with the same or similar values for the potential post-treatment variable at all treatment levels. The literature has focused mainly on binary post-treatment variables. Few papers considered continuous post-treatment variables. In the presence of a continuous post-treatment, a challenge is how to identify and characterize meaningful coarsening of the latent principal strata that lead to interpretable principal causal effects. This paper introduces the Confounders-Aware SHared atoms BAyesian mixture (CASBAH), a novel approach for principal stratification with binary treatment and continuous post-treatment variables. CASBAH leverages Bayesian nonparametric priors with an innovative hierarchical structure for the potential post-treatment outcomes that overcomes some of the limitations of previous works. Specifically, the novel features of our method allow for (i) identifying coarsened principal strata through a data-adaptive approach and (ii) providing a comprehensive quantification of the uncertainty surrounding stratum membership. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed methodology performs better than existing methods in characterizing the principal strata and estimating principal effects of the treatment. Finally, CASBAH is applied to a case study in which we estimate the causal effects of US national air quality regulations on pollution levels and health outcomes.</p></details> |  |

This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Mendelian Randomization Methods for Causal Inference: Estimands, Identification and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11519v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mendelian randomization (MR) has become an essential tool for causal inference in biomedical and public health research. By using genetic variants as instrumental variables, MR helps address unmeasured confounding and reverse causation, offering a quasi-experimental framework to evaluate causal effects of modifiable exposures on health outcomes. Despite its promise, MR faces substantial methodological challenges, including invalid instruments, weak instrument bias, and design complexities across different data structures. In this tutorial review, we provide a comprehensive overview of MR methods for causal inference, emphasizing clarity of causal interpretation, study design comparisons, availability of software tools, and practical guidance for applied scientists. We organize the review around causal estimands, ensuring that analyses are anchored to well-defined causal questions. We discuss the problems of invalid and weak instruments, comparing available strategies for their detection and correction. We integrate discussions of population-based versus family-based MR designs, analyses based on individual-level versus summary-level data, and one-sample versus two-sample MR designs, highlighting their relative advantages and limitations. We also summarize recent methodological advances and software developments that extend MR to settings with many weak or invalid instruments and to modern high-dimensional omics data. Real-data applications, including UK Biobank and Alzheimer's disease proteomics studies, illustrate the use of these methods in practice. This review aims to serve as a tutorial-style reference for both methodologists and applied scientists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanism Learning: reverse causal inference in the presence of multiple unknown confounding through causally weighted Gaussian mixture models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20057v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major limitation of machine learning (ML) prediction models is that they recover associational, rather than causal, predictive relationships between variables. In high-stakes automation applications of ML this is problematic, as the model often learns spurious, non-causal associations. This paper proposes mechanism learning, a simple method which uses causally weighted Gaussian Mixture Models (CW-GMMs) to deconfound observational data such that any appropriate ML model is forced to learn predictive relationships between effects and their causes (reverse causal inference), despite the potential presence of multiple unknown and unmeasured confounding. Effect variables can be very high-dimensional, and the predictive relationship nonlinear, as is common in ML applications. This novel method is widely applicable, the only requirement is the existence of a set of mechanism variables mediating the cause (prediction target) and effect (feature data), which is independent of the (unmeasured) confounding variables. We test our method on fully synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that it can discover reliable, unbiased, causal ML predictors where by contrast, the same ML predictor trained naively using classical supervised learning on the original observational data, is heavily biased by spurious associations. We provide code to implement the results in the paper, online.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[How causal perspectives can inform neuroscience data analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10710v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two decades, considerable strides have been made in advancing neuroscientific techniques, yet challenges remain in attributing causality to observed associations. This review addresses a fundamental issue in observational neuroscience studies and advocates for incorporating causal inference frameworks into standard practice. We systematically introduce necessary definitions and concepts, emphasizing how causal assumptions underlie statistical analyses even when not explicitly stated. Through a running example on sleep quality and white matter integrity, we illustrate how persistent challenges, including confounding and selection biases, can be conceptualized and addressed using causal frameworks. We demonstrate practical approaches for making assumption violations transparent through hands-on examples: supplementary case studies using multi-site harmonization and head motion exclusion procedures provide step-by-step diagnostic techniques for checking covariate overlap and identifying selection bias through exclusion pattern analysis. We explore how these causal perspectives can inform both experimental design and analytical choices, particularly for observational studies where traditional randomization is infeasible. Together, we believe this framework offers concrete tools for strengthening causal interpretations and inspiring more robust approaches to problems in neuroscience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Penalized Empirical Likelihood for Doubly Robust Causal Inference under Contamination in High Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17439v4)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a doubly robust estimator for the average treatment effect in high dimensional low sample size observational studies, where contamination and model misspecification pose serious inferential challenges. The estimator combines bounded influence estimating equations for outcome modeling with covariate balancing propensity scores for treatment assignment, embedded within a penalized empirical likelihood framework using nonconvex regularization. It satisfies the oracle property by jointly achieving consistency under partial model correct ness, selection consistency, robustness to contamination, and asymptotic normality. For uncertainty quantification, we derive a finite sample confidence interval using cumulant generating functions and influence function corrections, avoiding reliance on asymptotic approximations. Simulation studies and applications to gene expression datasets (Golub and Khan) demonstrate superior performance in bias, error metrics, and interval calibration, highlighting the method robustness and inferential validity in HDLSS regimes. One notable aspect is that even in the absence of contamination, the proposed estimator and its confidence interval remain efficient compared to those of competing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling US Climate Policy Uncertainty: From Causal Identification to Probabilistic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12276v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) is critical for designing effective climate strategies that balance economic growth with environmental objectives. Elevated CPU levels deter investment in green technologies, delay regulatory implementation, and amplify public resistance to policy reforms, particularly during economic stress. Despite the growing literature highlighting the economic relevance of CPU, the mechanisms through which macroeconomic and financial conditions influence its fluctuations remain insufficiently explored. This study addresses this gap by integrating four complementary causal inference techniques to identify statistically and economically significant determinants of the United States (US) CPU index. Impulse response analysis confirms their dynamic effects on CPU, highlighting the role of housing market activity, credit conditions, and financial market sentiment in shaping CPU fluctuations. The identified predictors, along with sentiment based Google Trends indicators, are incorporated into a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) framework for probabilistic forecasting. The inclusion of Google Trends data captures behavioral and attention based dynamics, leading to notable improvements in forecast accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of BSTS over state of the art classical and modern architectures for medium and long term forecasts, which are most relevant for climate policy implementation. The feature importance plot provides evidence that the spike-and-slab prior mechanism provides interpretable variable selection. The credible intervals quantify forecast uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's transparency and policy relevance by enabling strategic decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects for Spatio-Temporal Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15128v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scholars from diverse fields increasingly rely on high-frequency spatio-temporal data. Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal variables. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression, covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Causal Relationships Between Time Series With Spatial Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26485v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery is the subfield of causal inference concerned with estimating the structure of cause-and-effect relationships in a system of interrelated variables, as opposed to quantifying the strength of causal effects. As interest in causal discovery builds in fields such as ecology, public health, and environmental sciences where data is regularly collected with spatial and temporal structures, approaches must evolve to manage autocorrelation and complex confounding. As it stands, the few proposed causal discovery algorithms for spatiotemporal data require summarizing across locations, ignore spatial autocorrelation, and/or scale poorly to high dimensions. Here, we introduce our developing framework that extends time-series causal discovery to systems with spatial structure, building upon work on causal discovery across contexts and methods for handling spatial confounding in causal effect estimation. We close by outlining remaining gaps in the literature and directions for future research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Predictive Causal Inference via Spatio-Temporal Modeling and Penalized Empirical Likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08896v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces an integrated framework for predictive causal inference designed to overcome limitations inherent in conventional single model approaches. Specifically, we combine a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for spatial health state estimation with a Multi Task and Multi Graph Convolutional Network (MTGCN) for capturing temporal outcome trajectories. The framework asymmetrically treats temporal and spatial information regarding them as endogenous variables in the outcome regression, and exogenous variables in the propensity score model, thereby expanding the standard doubly robust treatment effect estimation to jointly enhance bias correction and predictive accuracy. To demonstrate its utility, we focus on clinical domains such as cancer, dementia, and Parkinson disease, where treatment effects are challenging to observe directly. Simulation studies are conducted to emulate latent disease dynamics and evaluate the model performance under varying conditions. Overall, the proposed framework advances predictive causal inference by structurally adapting to spatiotemporal complexities common in biomedical data.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02781v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches, deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias-Corrected Data Synthesis for Imbalanced Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26046v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the minority group and then training classification models with both observed and synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 4 figures, includes proofs and appendix</p></details> |

E.g., in a clinical trial, it may be of interest to find a subgroup with a positive average treatment effect. However, existing methods either lack inferential guarantees, heavily restrict the search for the subgroup, or sacrifice efficiency by naive data splitting. We propose a novel framework called chiseling that allows the analyst to interactively refine and test a candidate subgroup by iteratively shrinking it. The sole restriction is that the shrinkage direction only depends on the points outside the current subgroup, but otherwise the analyst may leverage any prior information or machine learning algorithm. Despite this flexibility, chiseling controls the probability that the discovered subgroup is null (e.g., has a non-positive average treatment effect) under minimal assumptions: for example, in randomized experiments, this inferential validity guarantee holds under only bounded moment conditions. When applied to a variety of simulated datasets and a real survey experiment, chiseling identifies substantially better subgroups than existing methods with inferential guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>26+7+...</summary><p>26+7+97 pages (main text, references, appendix), 6+15 figures (main text, appendix); fixed some references; added link to reproducible code repository</p></details> |
| **[Efficient nonparametric estimation with difference-in-differences in the presence of network dependence and interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03414v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differences-in-differences (DiD) is a causal inference method for observational longitudinal data that assumes parallel expected potential outcome trajectories between treatment groups under the counterfactual scenario where all units receive a specific treatment. In this paper DiD is extended to allow for: (i) non-identically distributed treatment effects and exposure probabilities; (ii) network dependency, where outcomes, treatments, and covariates may exhibit between-unit correlation; and (iii) interference, where treatments can affect outcomes in neighboring units. The causal estimand of interest is the network averaged expected exposure effect if units received a specific exposure level, where a unit's exposure is a function of its own treatment and its neighbors' treatments. Under a conditional parallel trends assumption and suitable network dependency and heterogeneity conditions, a doubly robust estimator allowing for data-adaptive nuisance function estimation is proposed and shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient. The proposed methods are evaluated in simulations and applied to study the effects of adopting emission control technologies in coal power plants on county-level mortality due to cardiovascular disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path-specific effects for pulse-oximetry guided decisions in critical care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12371v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical disparities linking device measurement errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. This study causally investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency, and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets: MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a novel pipeline for investigating potential disparities in clinical decision-making and, more importantly, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly assess fairness in healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25128v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome. However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real data experiments to support our case.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Replicable Bandits for Digital Health Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15377v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive treatment assignment algorithms, such as bandit algorithms, are increasingly used in digital health intervention clinical trials. Frequently, the data collected from these trials is used to conduct causal inference and related data analyses to decide how to refine the intervention, and whether to roll-out the intervention more broadly. This work studies inference for estimands that depend on the adaptive algorithm itself; a simple example is the mean reward under the adaptive algorithm. Specifically, we investigate the replicability of statistical analyses concerning such estimands when using data from trials deploying adaptive treatment assignment algorithms. We demonstrate that many standard statistical estimators can be inconsistent and fail to be replicable across repetitions of the clinical trial, even as the sample size grows large. We show that this non-replicability is intimately related to properties of the adaptive algorithm itself. We introduce a formal definition of a "replicable bandit algorithm" and prove that under such algorithms, a wide variety of common statistical estimators are guaranteed to be consistent and asymptotically normal. We present both theoretical results and simulation studies based on a mobile health oral health self-care intervention. Our findings underscore the importance of designing adaptive algorithms with replicability in mind, especially for settings like digital health, where deployment decisions rely heavily on replicated evidence. We conclude by discussing open questions on the connections between algorithm design, statistical inference, and experimental replicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updating acknowledgements</p></details> |
| **[Machine-Learning-Assisted Comparison of Regression Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24714v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the classical problem of comparing regression functions, a fundamental question in statistical inference with broad relevance to modern applications such as data integration, transfer learning, and causal inference. Existing approaches typically rely on smoothing techniques and are thus hindered by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a generalized notion of kernel-based conditional mean dependence that provides a new characterization of the null hypothesis of equal regression functions. Building on this reformulation, we develop two novel tests that leverage modern machine learning methods for flexible estimation. We establish the asymptotic properties of the test statistics, which hold under both fixed- and high-dimensional regimes. Unlike existing methods that often require restrictive distributional assumptions, our framework only imposes mild moment conditions. The efficacy of the proposed tests is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, however, either rely on strong structural assumptions or fail to handle key challenges such as interference, spatial confounding, temporal carryover, and time-varying confounding -- where covariates are influenced by past treatments and, in turn, affect future ones. We introduce GST-UNet (G-computation Spatio-Temporal UNet), a theoretically grounded neural framework that combines a U-Net-based spatiotemporal encoder with regression-based iterative G-computation to estimate location-specific potential outcomes under complex intervention sequences. GST-UNet explicitly adjusts for time-varying confounders and captures non-linear spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling valid causal inference from a single observed trajectory in data-scarce settings. We validate its effectiveness in synthetic experiments and in a real-world analysis of wildfire smoke exposure and respiratory hospitalizations during the 2018 California Camp Fire. Together, these results position GST-UNet as a principled and ready-to-use framework for spatiotemporal causal inference, advancing reliable estimation in policy-relevant and scientific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17637v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Causal Discovery using Judo Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23942v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science -- causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes, not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based, constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal discovery methods.</p></details> | 54 pages |

However, selecting an appropriate estimator from dozens of specialized methods demands substantial manual effort and domain expertise. We present CausalPFN, a single transformer that amortizes this workflow: trained once on a large library of simulated data-generating processes that satisfy ignorability, it infers causal effects for new observational datasets out of the box. CausalPFN combines ideas from Bayesian causal inference with the large-scale training protocol of prior-fitted networks (PFNs), learning to map raw observations directly to causal effects without any task-specific adjustment. Our approach achieves superior average performance on heterogeneous and average treatment effect estimation benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC). Moreover, it shows competitive performance for real-world policy making on uplift modeling tasks. CausalPFN provides calibrated uncertainty estimates to support reliable decision-making based on Bayesian principles. This ready-to-use model requires no further training or tuning and takes a step toward automated causal inference (https://github.com/vdblm/CausalPFN/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deep Q Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23424v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance. Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning agents through principled causal inference.</p></details> |  |

Without architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness: identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and +10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+ formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios. These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments.

On the other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and human feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms (orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize both unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then, we design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted intervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, the mechanisms and extent of this impact are still unclear. This study, using AlphaFold's impact on structural biologists, examines how AI technologies influence interdisciplinary collaborative patterns. By analyzing 1,247 AlphaFold-related papers and 7,700 authors from Scopus, we employ bibliometric analysis and causal inference to compare interdisciplinary collaboration between AlphaFold adopters and non-adopters. Contrary to the widespread belief that AI facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, our findings show that AlphaFold increased structural biology-computer science collaborations by just 0.48%, with no measurable effect on other disciplines. Specifically, AI creates interdisciplinary collaboration demands with specific disciplines due to its technical characteristics, but this demand is weakened by technological democratization and other factors. These findings demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) alone has limited efficacy in bridging disciplinary divides or fostering meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration.</p></details> | 29pages, 2figures |

Yet, both natural and artificial views on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>paper...</summary><p>paper presented at the 10th AIC workshop (AI & cognition) at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Under the potential outcomes framework, recent research has studied time-series experiments from the design-based perspective, relying solely on the randomness in the design to drive the statistical inference. Focusing on simpler statistical methods, we examine the design-based properties of regression-based methods for estimating treatment effects in time-series experiments. We demonstrate that the treatment effects of interest can be consistently estimated using ordinary least squares with an appropriately specified working model and transformed regressors. Our analysis allows for estimating a diverging number of treatment effects simultaneously, and establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of the regression-based estimators. Additionally, we show that asymptotically, the heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance estimators provide conservative estimates of the true, design-based variances. Importantly, although our approach relies on regression, our design-based framework allows for misspecification of the regression model.</p></details> | 53 pages |

Therefore, long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However, existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove the "bad" while keep the "good". We achieve new state-of-the-arts on three long-tailed visual recognition benchmarks: Long-tailed CIFAR-10/-100, ImageNet-LT for image classification and LVIS for instance segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2020.

Given such SGG, the down-stream tasks such as VQA can hardly infer better scene structures than merely a bag of objects. However, debiasing in SGG is not trivial because traditional debiasing methods cannot distinguish between the good and bad bias, e.g., good context prior (e.g., "person read book" rather than "eat") and bad long-tailed bias (e.g., "near" dominating "behind / in front of"). In this paper, we present a novel SGG framework based on causal inference but not the conventional likelihood. We first build a causal graph for SGG, and perform traditional biased training with the graph. Then, we propose to draw the counterfactual causality from the trained graph to infer the effect from the bad bias, which should be removed. In particular, we use Total Direct Effect (TDE) as the proposed final predicate score for unbiased SGG. Note that our framework is agnostic to any SGG model and thus can be widely applied in the community who seeks unbiased predictions. By using the proposed Scene Graph Diagnosis toolkit on the SGG benchmark Visual Genome and several prevailing models, we observed significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR 2020.

When participants do not adhere to their assigned treatments, we leverage treatment assignment as an instrumental variable to identify the local distributional treatment effect-the difference in outcome distributions between treatment and control groups for the subpopulation of compliers. We propose a regression-adjusted estimator based on a distribution regression framework with Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions, enabling robustness and flexibility with high-dimensional covariates. Our approach accommodates continuous, discrete, and mixed discrete-continuous outcomes, and applies under a broad class of covariate-adaptive randomization schemes, including stratified block designs and simple random sampling.

Although the field has witnessed remarkable advances over the past few years, it remains statistically and computationally challenging to learn a single (point estimate) DAG from data, let alone provide uncertainty quantification. We address the difficult task of quantifying graph uncertainty by developing a Bayesian variational inference framework based on novel, provably valid distributions that have support directly on the space of sparse DAGs. These distributions, which we use to define our prior and variational posterior, are induced by a projection operation that maps an arbitrary continuous distribution onto the space of sparse weighted acyclic adjacency matrices. While this projection is combinatorial, it can be solved efficiently using recent continuous reformulations of acyclicity constraints. We empirically demonstrate that our method, ProDAG, can outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |
| **[MECD+: Unlocking Event-Level Causal Graph Discovery for Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07227v4)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video causal reasoning aims to achieve a high-level understanding of videos from a causal perspective. However, it exhibits limitations in its scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on brief video segments containing isolated events and basic causal relations, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple interconnected events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relations between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD identifies the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive and structured event-level video causal graph explaining why and how the result event occurred. To address the challenges of MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, incorporating an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test. It estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to mitigate challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Additionally, context chain reasoning is introduced to conduct more robust and generalized reasoning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in reasoning complete causal relations, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoChat2 by 5.77% and 2.70%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrate that causal relation graphs can also contribute to downstream video understanding tasks such as video question answering and video event prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.17647</p></details> |
| **[SteerX: Disentangled Steering for LLM Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22256v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years, enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely. Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However, existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector, ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled steering method that isolates preference-driven components from preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens, transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical solution for more effective LLM personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Nuisance Function Tuning for Estimating a Doubly Robust Functional under Proportional Asymptotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25536v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the asymptotically optimal tuning parameter choice in ridge regression for estimating nuisance functions of a statistical functional that has recently gained prominence in conditional independence testing and causal inference. Given a sample of size $n$, we study estimators of the Expected Conditional Covariance (ECC) between variables $Y$ and $A$ given a high-dimensional covariate $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$. Under linear regression models for $Y$ and $A$ on $X$ and the proportional asymptotic regime $p/n \to c \in (0, \infty)$, we evaluate three existing ECC estimators and two sample splitting strategies for estimating the required nuisance functions. Since no consistent estimator of the nuisance functions exists in the proportional asymptotic regime without imposing further structure on the problem, we first derive debiased versions of the ECC estimators that utilize the ridge regression nuisance function estimators. We show that our bias correction strategy yields $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimators of the ECC across different sample splitting strategies and estimator choices. We then derive the asymptotic variances of these debiased estimators to illustrate the nuanced interplay between the sample splitting strategy, estimator choice, and tuning parameters of the nuisance function estimators for optimally estimating the ECC. Our analysis reveals that prediction-optimal tuning parameters (i.e., those that optimally estimate the nuisance functions) may not lead to the lowest asymptotic variance of the ECC estimator -- thereby demonstrating the need to be careful in selecting tuning parameters based on the final goal of inference. Finally, we verify our theoretical results through extensive numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirically assessing the plausibility of unconfoundedness in observational studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10156v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The possibility of unmeasured confounding is one of the main limitations for causal inference from observational studies. There are different methods for (partially) empirically assessing the plausibility of unconfoundedness. However, most currently available methods require (at least partial) assumptions about the confounding structure, which may be difficult to know in practice. In this paper we describe a simple strategy for empirically assessing the plausibility of conditional unconfoundedness (i.e., whether the candidate adjustment set of covariates suffices for confounding adjustment) which does not require any explicit assumptions about the confounding structure, relying instead on assumptions related to temporal ordering between covariates, exposure and outcome (which can be guaranteed by design) and selection into the study. The proposed method essentially relies on testing the association between a subset of the covariates included in the adjustment set (those associated with the exposure, given all other covariates) and the outcome conditional on the remaining covariates and the exposure. We describe the assumptions underlying the method, provide proofs, use simulations to corroborate the theory and illustrate the method with an applied example assessing the causal effect of delivery mode and intelligence quotient measured in adulthood using data from the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort. We also discuss the implications of measurement error and some important limitations of the suggested approach.</p></details> |  |

Yet they might still fail when confronted with the unexpected. A resilient system is able to adapt to real-world complexity, including operating conditions completely unanticipated during system design. This makes resilience a vital attribute for communication systems that must sustain service in scenarios where models are absent or too intricate to provide statistical guarantees. Such considerations indicate that artifical intelligence (AI) will play a major role in delivering resilience. In this paper, we examine the challenges of designing AIs for resilient radio access networks, especially with respect to unanticipated and rare disruptions. Our theoretical results indicate strong limitations of current statistical learning methods for resilience and suggest connections to online learning and causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshop on Resilience in Next-Generation Wireless Communication Networks</p></details> |

SDR addresses endogenous treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations. The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when agents respond strategically to interventions.</p></details> |  |

Training once per dataset using just observational data and the underlying causal graph, DeCaFlow enables accurate causal inference on continuous variables under the presence of hidden confounders. Specifically, we extend previous results on causal estimation under hidden confounding to show that a single instance of DeCaFlow provides correct estimates for all causal queries identifiable with do-calculus, leveraging proxy variables to adjust for the causal effects when do-calculus alone is insufficient. Moreover, we show that counterfactual queries are identifiable as long as their interventional counterparts are identifiable, and thus are also correctly estimated by DeCaFlow. Our empirical results on diverse settings (including the Ecoli70 dataset, with 3 independent hidden confounders, tens of observed variables and hundreds of causal queries) show that DeCaFlow outperforms existing approaches, while demonstrating its out-of-the-box applicability to any given causal graph.

| **[Bridging Prediction and Attribution: Identifying Forward and Backward Causal Influence Ranges Using Assimilative Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21889v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference identifies cause-and-effect relationships between variables. While traditional approaches rely on data to reveal causal links, a recently developed method, assimilative causal inference (ACI), integrates observations with dynamical models. It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes back from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI advances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the intermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal connections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated causal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for how long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically rigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The forward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR traces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal predictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase, respectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced, eliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient approximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the use of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate how this forward and backward CIR framework provides new possibilities for probing complex dynamical systems. It advances the study of bifurcation-driven and noise-induced tipping points in Earth systems, investigates the impact from resolving the interfering variables when determining the influence ranges, and elucidates atmospheric blocking mechanisms in the equatorial region. These results have direct implications for science, policy, and decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages (Main Text pp. 1--25; Supplementary Materials/Appendix pp. 26--35), 9 figures (all in Main Text).

| **[Prediction-Powered Causal Inferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06343v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scientific experiments, the data annotating cost constraints the pace for testing novel hypotheses. Yet, modern machine learning pipelines offer a promising solution, provided their predictions yield correct conclusions. We focus on Prediction-Powered Causal Inferences (PPCI), i.e., estimating the treatment effect in an unlabeled target experiment, relying on training data with the same outcome annotated but potentially different treatment or effect modifiers. We first show that conditional calibration guarantees valid PPCI at population level. Then, we introduce a sufficient representation constraint transferring validity across experiments, which we propose to enforce in practice in Deconfounded Empirical Risk Minimization, our new model-agnostic training objective. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world scientific data, solving impossible problem instances for Empirical Risk Minimization even with standard invariance constraints. In particular, for the first time, we achieve valid causal inference on a scientific experiment with complex recording and no human annotations, fine-tuning a foundational model on our similar annotated experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Handling Missing Responses under Cluster Dependence with Applications to Language Model Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20928v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human annotations play a crucial role in evaluating the performance of GenAI models. Two common challenges in practice, however, are missing annotations (the response variable of interest) and cluster dependence among human-AI interactions (e.g., questions asked by the same user may be highly correlated). Reliable inference must address both these issues to achieve unbiased estimation and appropriately quantify uncertainty when estimating average scores from human annotations. In this paper, we analyze the doubly robust estimator, a widely used method in missing data analysis and causal inference, applied to this setting and establish novel theoretical properties under cluster dependence. We further illustrate our findings through simulations and a real-world conversation quality dataset. Our theoretical and empirical results underscore the importance of incorporating cluster dependence in missing response problems to perform valid statistical inference.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |
| **[On Multiple Robustness of Proximal Dynamic Treatment Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20451v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic treatment regimes are sequential decision rules that adapt treatment according to individual time-varying characteristics and outcomes to achieve optimal effects, with applications in precision medicine, personalized recommendations, and dynamic marketing. Estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes via sequential randomized trials might face costly and ethical hurdles, often necessitating the use of historical observational data. In this work, we utilize proximal causal inference framework for learning optimal dynamic treatment regimes when the unconfoundedness assumption fails. Our contributions are four-fold: (i) we propose three nonparametric identification methods for optimal dynamic treatment regimes; (ii) we establish the semiparametric efficiency bound for the value function of a given regime; (iii) we propose a (K+1)-robust method for learning optimal dynamic treatment regimes, where K is the number of stages; (iv) as a by-product for marginal structural models, we establish identification and estimation of counterfactual means under a static regime. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency and multiple robustness of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification and Debiased Learning of Causal Effects with General Instrumental Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20404v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning. Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative instrumental variables are further developed. We demonstrate the proposed method by employing simulation studies and analyzing real data from the Job Training Partnership Act program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias-Variance Tradeoff of Matching Prior to Difference-in-Differences When Parallel Trends is Violated](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20191v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasi-experimental causal inference methods have become central in empirical operations management (OM) for guiding managerial decisions. Among these, empiricists utilize the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator, which relies on the parallel trends assumption. To improve its plausibility, researchers often match treated and control units before applying DiD, with the intuition that matched groups are more likely to evolve similarly absent treatment. Existing work that analyze this practice, however, has focused solely on bias. We complement and fill an important gap by analyzing the full bias-variance tradeoff. Under a linear structural model with unobserved time-varying confounders, we show that variance results contrast with established bias insights: matching on observed covariates prior to DiD is not always recommended over the classic (unmatched) DiD due to a sample size tradeoff; furthermore, matching additionally on pre-treatment outcomes is always beneficial as such tradeoff no longer exists once matching is performed. We therefore advocate mean squared error (MSE) as a final metric and give practitioner-friendly guidelines with theoretical guarantees on when (and on what variables) they should match on. We apply these insights to a recent study on how the introduction of monetary incentives by a knowledge-sharing platform affects its general engagement and show that the authors' matching choice prior to DiD was both warranted and critical. In particular, we provide new managerial insights that after a full bias correction, their estimated effect with matching still remains statistically significant, demonstrating that the chosen matching-DiD approach is sufficiently robust to address managerial concerns over violations of parallel trends.</p></details> |  |

Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear saturation effects [@Chan2017; @Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian]. **DeepCausalMMM** is a Python package that addresses these limitations by combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning [@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize budget allocation. Key features include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for understanding channel saturation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software) Journal for Publishing.

| **[Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping on Sea Ice Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001v5)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Sigspatial Conference, PolDS Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Long-term Causal Inference via Modeling Sequential Latent Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18994v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term causal inference is an important but challenging problem across various scientific domains. To solve the latent confounding problem in long-term observational studies, existing methods leverage short-term experimental data. Ghassami et al. propose an approach based on the Conditional Additive Equi-Confounding Bias (CAECB) assumption, which asserts that the confounding bias in the short-term outcome is equal to that in the long-term outcome, so that the long-term confounding bias and the causal effects can be identified. While effective in certain cases, this assumption is limited to scenarios where there is only one short-term outcome with the same scale as the long-term outcome. In this paper, we introduce a novel assumption that extends the CAECB assumption to accommodate temporal short-term outcomes. Our proposed assumption states a functional relationship between sequential confounding biases across temporal short-term outcomes, under which we theoretically establish the identification of long-term causal effects. Based on the identification result, we develop an estimator and conduct a theoretical analysis of its asymptotic properties. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Targeted-Federated Learning Framework for Estimating Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects: A Robust Framework with Applications in Aging Cohorts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19243v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing data from multiple sources offers valuable opportunities to improve the estimation efficiency of causal estimands. However, this analysis also poses many challenges due to population heterogeneity and data privacy constraints. While several advanced methods for causal inference in federated settings have been developed in recent years, many focus on difference-based averaged causal effects and are not designed to study effect modification. In this study, we introduce a novel targeted-federated learning framework to study the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs) for a targeted population by proposing a projection-based estimand. This HTE framework integrates information from multiple data sources without sharing raw data, while accounting for covariate distribution shifts among sources. Our proposed approach is shown to be doubly robust, conveniently supporting both difference-based estimands for continuous outcomes and odds ratio-based estimands for binary outcomes. Furthermore, we develop a communication-efficient bootstrap-based selection procedure to detect non-transportable data sources, thereby enhancing robust information aggregation without introducing bias. The superior performance of the proposed estimator over existing methods is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies, and the utility of our approach has been shown in a real-world data application using nationwide Medicare-linked data.</p></details> |  |

This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism. Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models, particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally Perturbed Fairness Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18719v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features (e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT. Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators. Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation, CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all cases.</p></details> | accepted by TOSEM |

In TCGA breast cancer (n=967, 133 deaths), low event rates (13.8%) create severe power limitations, producing false negatives for known drivers and false positives for large passenger genes. Results: We developed a five-criteria computational framework integrating causal inference (inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimation) with orthogonal biological validation (expression, mutation patterns, literature evidence). Applied to TCGA-BRCA mortality analysis, standard Cox+FDR detected zero genes at FDR<0.05, confirming complete failure in underpowered settings. Our framework correctly identified RYR2 -- a cardiac gene with no cancer function -- as a false positive despite nominal significance (p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate requiring validation despite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954). Power analysis revealed median power of 15.1% across genes, with KMT2C achieving only 29.8% power (HR=1.55), explaining borderline statistical significance despite strong biological evidence. The framework distinguished true signals from artifacts through mutation pattern analysis: RYR2 showed 29.8% silent mutations (passenger signature) with no hotspots, while KMT2C showed 6.7% silent mutations with 31.4% truncating variants (driver signature).

To develop an automated way of online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover, plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Validate Counterfactual Estimations in the Presence of General Network Interference?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01106v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized experiments have become a cornerstone of evidence-based decision-making in contexts ranging from online platforms to public health. However, in experimental settings with network interference, a unit's treatment can influence outcomes of other units, challenging both causal effect estimation and its validation. Classic validation approaches fail as outcomes are only observable under a single treatment scenario and exhibit complex correlation patterns due to interference. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework that facilitates the use of machine learning tools for both estimation and validation in causal inference. Central to our approach is the new distribution-preserving network bootstrap, a theoretically-grounded technique that generates multiple statistically-valid subpopulations from a single experiment's data. This amplification of experimental samples enables our second contribution: a counterfactual cross-validation procedure. This procedure adapts the principles of model validation to the unique constraints of causal settings, providing a rigorous, data-driven method for selecting and evaluating estimators. We extend recent causal message-passing developments by incorporating heterogeneous unit-level characteristics and varying local interactions, ensuring reliable finite-sample performance through non-asymptotic analysis. Additionally, we develop and publicly release a comprehensive benchmark toolbox featuring diverse experimental environments, from networks of interacting AI agents to ride-sharing applications. These environments provide known ground truth values while maintaining realistic complexities, enabling systematic evaluation of causal inference methods. Extensive testing across these environments demonstrates our method's robustness to diverse forms of network interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Influence Component Analysis: A Geometric Approach to Nonlinear Mixture Identifiability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17040v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function, to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

We present a formal decomposition of between-study heterogeneity, identifying sources of variability in treatment effects across studies. The proposed methodology allows for robust estimation of causal parameters under various assumptions, addressing differences in pre-treatment covariate distributions, mediating variables, and the outcome mechanism. Our approach is validated through a simulation study and applied to data from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study, demonstrating its practical relevance. This work contributes to the broader understanding of causal inference in multi-study environments, with potential applications in evidence synthesis and policy-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>revis...</summary><p>revision and reorganization of text, updated simulation study</p></details> |
| **[Intuitionistic $j$-Do-Calculus in Topos Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17944v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we generalize Pearl's do-calculus to an Intuitionistic setting called $j$-stable causal inference inside a topos of sheaves. Our framework is an elaboration of the recently proposed framework of Topos Causal Models (TCMs), where causal interventions are defined as subobjects. We generalize the original setting of TCM using the Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos, defined by a modal operator $j$ on the subobject classifier $\Omega$. We introduce $j$-do-calculus, where we replace global truth with local truth defined by Kripke-Joyal semantics, and formalize causal reasoning as structure-preserving morphisms that are stable along $j$-covers. $j$-do-calculus is a sound rule system whose premises and conclusions are formulas of the internal Intuitionistic logic of the causal topos. We define $j$-stability for conditional independences and interventional claims as local truth in the internal logic of the causal topos. We give three inference rules that mirror Pearl's insertion/deletion and action/observation exchange, and we prove soundness in the Kripke-Joyal semantics. A companion paper in preparation will describe how to estimate the required entities from data and instantiate $j$-do with standard discovery procedures (e.g., score-based and constraint-based methods), and will include experimental results on how to (i) form data-driven $j$-covers (via regime/section constructions), (ii) compute chartwise conditional independences after graph surgeries, and (iii) glue them to certify the premises of the $j$-do rules in practice</p></details> | 42 pages |

Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically, when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Variance Decompositions for Measuring Health Inequalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16975v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent causal inference literature has introduced causal effect decompositions to quantify sources of observed inequalities or disparities in outcomes but usually limiting this to pairwise comparisons. In the context of hospital profiling, comparison of hospital performance may reveal inequalities in healthcare delivery between sociodemographic groups, which may be explained by access/selection or actual effect modification. We consider the case of polytomous exposures in hospital profiling where the comparison is often to the system wide average performance, and decompose the observed variance in care delivery as the quantity of interest. For this, we formulate a new eight-way causal variance decomposition where we attribute the observed variation to components describing the main effects of hospital and group membership, modification of the hospital effect by group membership, hospital access/selection, effect of case-mix covariates and residual variance. We discuss the causal interpretation of the components, formulate parametric and nonparametric model based estimators and study the properties of these estimators through simulation. Finally, we illustrate our method by an example of cancer care delivery using data from the SEER database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal inference for calibrated scaling interventions on time-to-event processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16798v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies stochastic interventions in continuous-time event-history settings formulated as multiplicative scalings of the observed intensity governing an intermediate event process. This gives rise to a family of causal estimands indexed by a scalar parameter {\alpha}, which changes the event rate while preserving the temporal and covariate structure of the data-generating process. We introduce calibrated interventions, where \(\alpha\) is chosen to achieve a pre-specified goal, such as a desired level of cumulative risk of the intermediate event, and define corresponding composite target parameters capturing the resulting effects on the outcome process. Our proposal enables practical yet statistically principled intervention analysis in survival and longitudinal settings, which offers a flexible alternative to deterministic or static interventions that are often ill-defined. The framework applies broadly to causal questions involving time-to-event treatments or mediators, and offers a pragmatic analogue to indirect/direct effect decompositions. We present the efficient influence curves for various versions of target parameters under a nonparametric statistical model, discuss their double robustness properties, and propose an estimation procedure based on targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). The proposed estimands are illustrated through examples of event-history scenarios addressing distinct causal questions.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to solve large scale prediction problems using Generative Quantile Bayesian Prediction (GQBP).By directly learning predictive quantiles rather than densities we achieve a number of theoretical and practical advantages. We contrast our approach with state-of-the-art methods including conformal prediction, fiducial prediction and marginal likelihood. Our distinguishing feature of our method is the use of generative methods for predictive quantile maps. We illustrate our methodology for normal-normal learning and causal inference. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensitivity Analysis to Unobserved Confounders: A Comparative Review to Estimate Confounding Strength in Sensitivity Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16560v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference is only valid when its underlying assumptions are satisfied, one of the most central being the ignorability assumption (also known as unconfoundedness or exogeneity). In practice, however, this assumption is often unrealistic in observational studies, as some confounding variables may remain unobserved. To address this limitation, sensitivity models for Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) estimators, known as Marginal Sensitivity Models, have been introduced, allowing for a controlled relaxation of ignorability. Over the past decades, a substantial body of literature has emerged around these models, aiming to derive sharp and robust bounds for both binary and continuous treatment effects. A key element of these approaches is the specification of a sensitivity parameter, sometimes referred to as the "confounding strength", which quantifies the extent of deviation from ignorability. Yet, determining an appropriate value for this parameter is challenging, and the final interpretation of sensitivity analyses can be unclear. We believe these difficulties represent major obstacles to the adoption of such methods in practice. In this review, after introducing sensitivity analyses for IPW estimators, we focus on different strategies to estimate or lower bound the confounding strength, select the most suitable approach, and avoid common pitfalls in the interpretation of results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Varying Confounding Bias in Observational Geoscience with Application to Induced Seismicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16360v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evidence derived primarily from physical models has identified saltwater disposal as the dominant causal factor that contributes to induced seismicity. To complement physical models, statistical/machine learning (ML) models are designed to measure associations from observational data, either with parametric regression models or more flexible ML models. However, it is often difficult to interpret the statistical significance of a parameter or the predicative power of a model as evidence of causation. We adapt a causal inference framework with the potential outcomes perspective to explicitly define what we meant by causal effect and declare necessary identification conditions to recover unbiased causal effect estimates. In particular, we illustrate the threat of time-varying confounding in observational longitudinal geoscience data through simulations and adapt established statistical methods for longitudinal analysis from the causal interference literature to estimate the effect of wastewater disposal on earthquakes in the Fort-Worth Basin of North Central Texas from 2013 to 2016.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneity-Aware Federated Causal Inference Leveraging Effect-Measure Transportability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16317v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning of causal estimands offers a powerful strategy to improve estimation efficiency by leveraging data from multiple study sites while preserving privacy. Existing literature has primarily focused on the average treatment effect using single data source, whereas our work addresses a broader class of causal measures across multiple sources. We derive and compare semiparametrically efficient estimators under two transportability assumptions, which impose different restrictions on the data likelihood and illustrate the efficiency-robustness tradeoff. This estimator also permits the incorporation of flexible machine learning algorithms for nuisance functions while maintaining parametric convergence rates and nominal coverage. To further handle scenarios where some source sites violate transportability, we propose a Post-Federated Weighting Selection (PFWS) framework, which is a two-step procedure that adaptively identifies compatible sites and achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound asymptotically. This framework mitigates the efficiency loss of weighting methods and the instability and computational burden of direct site selection in finite samples. Through extensive simulations and real-data analysis, we demonstrate that our PFWS framework achieves superior variance efficiency compared with the target-only analyses across diverse transportability scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Auditing: Design-based Tests of Randomization, Selection, and Missingness with Broadly Accessible Satellite Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00128v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the benchmark for causal inference, yet field implementation can drift from the registered design or, by chance, yield imbalances. We introduce a remote audit -- a preregistrable, design-based diagnostic that uses strictly pre-treatment, publicly available satellite imagery to test whether assignment is independent of local conditions. The audit implements a conditional randomization test that asks whether treatment is more predictable from pre-treatment features than under the registered mechanism, delivering a finite-sample-valid, nonparametric check that honors blocks and clusters and controls multiplicity across image models, resolutions, and patch sizes via a max-statistic. The same preregistered procedure can be run before baseline data collection to guide implementation and, after assignments are realized, to audit the actual allocation. In two illustrations -- Uganda's Youth Opportunities Program (randomization corroborated) and a school-based experiment in Bangladesh (assignment predictable relative to the design, consistent with independent concerns) -- the audit can surface potential problems early, before costly scientific investments. We also provide descriptive diagnostics for selection into the study and for missingness. Because it is low-cost and can be implemented rapidly in a unified way across diverse global administrative jurisdictions, the remote audit complements balance tests, strengthens preregistration, and enables rapid design checks when conventional data collection is slow, expensive, or infeasible.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning density ratios in causal inference using Bregman-Riesz regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16127v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ratio of two probability density functions is a fundamental quantity that appears in many areas of statistics and machine learning, including causal inference, reinforcement learning, covariate shift, outlier detection, independence testing, importance sampling, and diffusion modeling. Naively estimating the numerator and denominator densities separately using, e.g., kernel density estimators, can lead to unstable performance and suffers from the curse of dimensionality as the number of covariates increases. For this reason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio directly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as the odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an observation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution. Additionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a continuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of the so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in the Riesz regression procedure in causal inference. In this paper we show that all three of these methods can be unified in a common framework, which we call Bregman-Riesz regression. We further show how data augmentation techniques can be used to apply density ratio learning methods to causal problems, where the numerator distribution typically represents an unobserved intervention. We show through simulations how the choice of Bregman divergence and data augmentation strategy can affect the performance of the resulting density ratio learner. A Python package is provided for researchers to apply Bregman-Riesz regression in practice using gradient boosting, neural networks, and kernel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repli...</summary><p>Replication code is available from https://github.com/CI-NYC/densityratios</p></details> |
| **[REX: Causal discovery based on machine learning and explainability techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12706v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques hold significant potential for enhancing the causal discovery process, which is crucial for understanding complex systems in areas like healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence. However, no causal discovery methods currently incorporate explainability into their models to derive the causal graphs. Thus, in this paper we explore this innovative approach, as it offers substantial potential and represents a promising new direction worth investigating. Specifically, we introduce ReX, a causal discovery method that leverages machine learning (ML) models coupled with explainability techniques, specifically Shapley values, to identify and interpret significant causal relationships among variables. Comparative evaluations on synthetic datasets comprising continuous tabular data reveal that ReX outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods across diverse data generation processes, including non-linear and additive noise models. Moreover, ReX was tested on the Sachs single-cell protein-signaling dataset, achieving a precision of 0.952 and recovering key causal relationships with no incorrect edges. Taking together, these results showcase ReX's effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures while minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse datasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and explainability techniques with causal discovery, ReX bridges the gap between predictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for understanding complex causal structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 30 figures, Published in Elsevier's Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000 accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road safety planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, The 8th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on AI for Geographic Knowledge Discovery (GeoAI '25), November 3--6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA</p></details> |
| **[Local Causal Discovery for Statistically Efficient Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14582v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery methods can identify valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation for a pair of target variables, even when the underlying causal graph is unknown. Global causal discovery methods focus on learning the whole causal graph and therefore enable the recovery of optimal adjustment sets, i.e., sets with the lowest asymptotic variance, but they quickly become computationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. Local causal discovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local neighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically suboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments Discovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines the computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality of global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the targets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local information. If it is identifiable, it then finds the optimal adjustment set by leveraging local causal discovery to infer the mediators and their parents. Otherwise, it returns the locally valid parent adjustment sets based on the learned local structure. In our experiments on synthetic and realistic data LOAD outperforms global methods in scalability, while providing more accurate effect estimation than local methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Doubly Robust Causal Inference via Posterior Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04868v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian doubly robust (DR) causal inference faces a fundamental dilemma: joint modeling of outcome and propensity score suffers from the feedback problem where outcome information contaminates propensity score estimation, while two-step analysis sacrifices valid posterior distributions for computational convenience. We resolve this dilemma through posterior coupling via entropic tilting. Our framework constructs independent posteriors for propensity score and outcome models, then couples them using entropic tilting to enforce the DR moment condition. This yields the first fully Bayesian DR estimator with an explicit posterior distribution. Theoretically, we establish three key properties: (i) when the outcome model is correctly specified, the tilted posterior coincides with the original; (ii) under propensity score model correctness, the posterior mean remains consistent despite outcome model misspecification; (iii) convergence rates improve for nonparametric outcome models. Simulations demonstrate superior bias reduction and efficiency compared to existing methods. We illustrate practical advantages of the proposed method through two applications: sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in antihypertensive treatment effects on dementia, and high-dimensional confounder selection combining shrinkage priors with modified moment conditions for right heart catheterization mortality. We provide an R package implementing the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Bayesian inference, Double robustness, Efficiency improvement, Entropic tilting, Propensity score</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily rely on modeling statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset, demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result, our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[APEX: Empowering LLMs with Physics-Based Task Planning for Real-time Insight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13921v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling. Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment, providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions, allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris, evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models, demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source code and experiment setup are publicly available at https://github.com/hwj20/APEX_EXP .</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularizing Extrapolation in Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17180v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many common estimators in machine learning and causal inference are linear smoothers, where the prediction is a weighted average of the training outcomes. Some estimators, such as ordinary least squares and kernel ridge regression, allow for arbitrarily negative weights, which improve feature imbalance but often at the cost of increased dependence on parametric modeling assumptions and higher variance. By contrast, estimators like importance weighting and random forests (sometimes implicitly) restrict weights to be non-negative, reducing dependence on parametric modeling and variance at the cost of worse imbalance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that directly penalizes the level of extrapolation, replacing the current practice of a hard non-negativity constraint with a soft constraint and corresponding hyperparameter. We derive a worst-case extrapolation error bound and introduce a novel "bias-bias-variance" tradeoff, encompassing biases due to feature imbalance, model misspecification, and estimator variance; this tradeoff is especially pronounced in high dimensions, particularly when positivity is poor. We then develop an optimization procedure that regularizes this bound while minimizing imbalance and outline how to use this approach as a sensitivity analysis for dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through synthetic experiments and a real-world application, involving the generalization of randomized controlled trial estimates to a target population of interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLOPE and Designing Robust Studies for Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01577v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular task in generalization is to learn about a new, target population based on data from an existing, source population. This task relies on conditional exchangeability, which asserts that differences between the source and target populations are fully captured by observable characteristics of the two populations. Unfortunately, this assumption is often untenable in practice due to unobservable differences between the source and target populations. Worse, the assumption cannot be verified with data, warranting the need for robust data collection processes and study designs that are inherently less sensitive to violation of the assumption. In this paper, we propose SLOPE (Sensitivity of LOcal Perturbations from Exchangeability), a simple, intuitive, and novel measure that quantifies the sensitivity to local violation of conditional exchangeability. SLOPE combines ideas from sensitivity analysis in causal inference and derivative-based measure of robustness from Hampel (1974). Among other properties, SLOPE can help investigators to choose (a) a robust source or target population or (b) a robust estimand. Also, we show an analytic relationship between SLOPE and influence functions, which investigators can use to derive SLOPE given an influence function. We conclude with a re-analysis of a multi-national randomized experiment and illustrate the role of SLOPE in informing robust study designs for generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploratory Causal Inference in SAEnce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14073v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless, they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification. After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments, we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Show Biases in Causal Learning? Insights from Contingency Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13985v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice, stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work, we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality. While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive models for panel data causal inference with application to state-level opioid policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09012v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the study of state opioid policies, we propose a novel approach that uses autoregressive models for causal effect estimation in settings with panel data and staggered treatment adoption. Specifically, we seek to estimate the impact of key opioid-related policies by quantifying the effects of must access prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), naloxone access laws (NALs), and medical marijuana laws on opioid prescribing. Existing methods, such as differences-in-differences and synthetic controls, are challenging to apply in these types of dynamic policy landscapes where multiple policies are implemented over time and sample sizes are small. Autoregressive models are an alternative strategy that have been used to estimate policy effects in similar settings, but until this paper have lacked formal justification. We outline a set of assumptions that tie these models to causal effects, and we study biases of estimates based on this approach when key causal assumptions are violated. In a set of simulation studies that mirror the structure of our application, we show that our proposed estimators frequently outperform existing estimators. In short, we justify the use of autoregressive models to evaluate the effectiveness of four state policies in combating the opioid crisis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards xApp Conflict Evaluation with Explainable Machine Learning and Causal Inference in O-RAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13031v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables a flexible, vendor-neutral deployment of 5G networks by disaggregating base station components and supporting third-party xApps for near real-time RAN control. However, the concurrent operation of multiple xApps can lead to conflicting control actions, which may cause network performance degradation. In this work, we propose a framework for xApp conflict management that combines explainable machine learning and causal inference to evaluate the causal relationships between RAN Control Parameters (RCPs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use model explainability tools such as SHAP to identify RCPs that jointly affect the same KPI, signaling potential conflicts, and represent these interactions as a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We then estimate the causal impact of each of these RCPs on their associated KPIs using metrics such as Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). This approach offers network operators guided insights into identifying conflicts and quantifying their impacts, enabling more informed and effective conflict resolution strategies across diverse xApp deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Joint Potential Outcome Distributions from a Single Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20506v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most causal inference methods focus on estimating marginal average treatment effects, but many important causal estimands depend on the joint distribution of potential outcomes, including the probability of causation and proportions benefiting from or harmed by treatment. Wu et al (2025) recently established nonparametric identification of this joint distribution for categorical outcomes under binary treatment by leveraging variation across multiple studies. We demonstrate that their multi-study framework can be implemented within a single study by using a baseline covariate that is associated with untreated potential outcomes but does not modify treatment effects conditional on those outcomes. This reframing substantially broadens the practical applicability of their results, as it eliminates the need for multiple independent datasets and gives analysts control over covariate selection to satisfy key identifying assumptions. We provide complete identification and estimation theory for the single-study setting, including a Neyman-orthogonal estimator for cases where the conditional independence assumption only holds after adjusting for covariates. However, we argue that only in unusual settings would it be even theoretically possible for the identifying assumptions to hold exactly, making sensitivity analysis particularly important. We validate the estimator in a simulation and apply it to data from a large field experiment assessing the effect of mailings on voter turnout.</p></details> |  |

The approach proceeds in three main stages: causal discovery, causal inference, and chronology construction. We apply it to the ndhB and ndhD genes of the chloroplast in Arabidopsis thaliana, generating four alternative maturation timeline models per gene, each derived from a different causal discovery algorithm (HC, PC, LiNGAM, or NOTEARS). Two methodological challenges are addressed: the presence of missing data, handled via an EM algorithm that jointly imputes missing values and estimates the Bayesian network, and the selection of the $\ell_1$-regularization parameter in NOTEARS, for which we introduce a stability selection strategy. The resulting causal models consistently outperform reference chronologies in terms of both reliability and model fit. Moreover, by combining causal reasoning with domain expertise, the framework enables the formulation of testable hypotheses and the design of targeted experimental interventions grounded in theoretical predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages.

To avoid ambiguity in interpretation, causal estimands should remain unchanged under relabeling, an implicit principle we refer to as permutation invariance. We formally characterize this principle, analyze its algebraic and combinatorial structure for verification, and present a class of weighted estimands that are permutation-invariant while capturing interactions of all orders. We further provide guidance on selecting weights that yield residual-free estimands, whose inclusion-exclusion sums capture the maximal effect, and extend our results to ratio effect measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveletDiff: Multilevel Wavelet Diffusion For Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11839v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting, classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation; however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$ smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.</p></details> |  |

Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. These hypergraphs offer a natural platform for organizing, communicating, and processing computational knowledge. While most scientific problems can be framed as the data-driven discovery of unknown functions in a computational hypergraph whose structure is known (Type 2), many require the data-driven discovery of the structure (connectivity) of the hypergraph itself (Type 3). We introduce an interpretable Gaussian Process (GP) framework for such (Type 3) problems that does not require randomization of the data, access to or control over its sampling, or sparsity of the unknown functions in a known or learned basis. Its polynomial complexity, which contrasts sharply with the super-exponential complexity of causal inference methods, is enabled by the nonlinear ANOVA capabilities of GPs used as a sensing mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>PNAS ...</summary><p>PNAS (2024).

| **[The Role of Congeniality in Multiple Imputation for Doubly Robust Causal Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11633v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides clear and practical guidance on the specification of imputation models when multiple imputation is used in conjunction with doubly robust estimation methods for causal inference. Through theoretical arguments and targeted simulations, we show that when a confounder has missing data the corresponding imputation model must include all variables used in either the propensity score model or the outcome model, and that these variables must appear in the same functional form as in the final analysis. Violating these conditions can lead to biased treatment effect estimates, even when both components of the doubly robust estimator are correctly specified. We present a mathematical framework for doubly robust estimation combined with multiple imputation, establish the theoretical requirements for proper imputation in this setting, and demonstrate the consequences of misspecification through simulation. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations to ensure valid inference when using multiple imputation with doubly robust methods in applied causal analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering and Reasoning of Causality in the Hidden World with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03941v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Revealing hidden causal variables alongside the underlying causal mechanisms is essential to the development of science. Despite the progress in the past decades, existing practice in causal discovery (CD) heavily relies on high-quality measured variables, which are usually given by human experts. In fact, the lack of well-defined high-level variables behind unstructured data has been a longstanding roadblock to a broader real-world application of CD. This procedure can naturally benefit from an automated process that can suggest potential hidden variables in the system. Interestingly, Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in processing unstructured data. To leverage the power of LLMs, we develop a new framework termed Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that incorporates the rich world knowledge of LLMs to propose useful measured variables for CD with respect to high-value target variables on their paired unstructured data. Instead of directly inferring causality with LLMs, COAT constructs feedback from intermediate CD results to LLMs to refine the proposed variables. Given the target variable and the paired unstructured data, we first develop COAT-MB that leverages the predictivity of the proposed variables to iteratively uncover the Markov Blanket of the target variable. Built upon COAT-MB, COAT-PAG further extends to uncover a more complete causal graph, i.e., Partial Ancestral Graph, by iterating over the target variables and actively seeking new high-level variables. Moreover, the reliable CD capabilities of COAT also extend the debiased causal inference to unstructured data by discovering an adjustment set. We establish theoretical guarantees for the CD results and verify their efficiency and reliability across realistic benchmarks and real-world case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our previous NeurIPS'24 conference paper (arXiv:2402.03941(2)); Chenxi and Yongqiang contributed equally; 78 pages, 44 figures; Project page: https://causalcoat.github.io/discovering-and-reasoning</p></details> |

Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Oral; Project Homepage: https://yanzehong.github.io/trust-vl/</p></details> |

We present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference, and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum: baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss, adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1% macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to 14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 24th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom 2025) Privacy track, 11 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23449v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Misinformation Detection using Large Language Models with Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18918v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[MIRAGE: Agentic Framework for Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Web-Grounded Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17590v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Towards Low-Resource Alignment to Diverse Perspectives with Sparse Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16257v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider nuanced perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2025, 5 pages</p></details> |
| **[Fact-R1: Towards Explainable Video Misinformation Detection with Deep Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16836v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinVet: A Collaborative Framework of RAG and External Fact-Checking Agents for Financial Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11654v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and Published in SBP-BRiMS 2025. 18th International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling & Prediction and Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing AI-driven detection systems often require domain-specific finetuning, limiting generalizability, and offer little insight into their decisions, hindering trust and adoption. We introduce MAD-Sherlock, a multi-agent debate system for out-of-context misinformation detection. MAD-Sherlock frames detection as a multi-agent debate, reflecting the diverse and conflicting discourse found online. Multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and retrieve external information to support cross-context reasoning. Our framework is domain- and time-agnostic, requiring no finetuning, yet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with in-depth explanations. Evaluated on NewsCLIPpings, VERITE, and MMFakeBench, it outperforms prior methods by 2%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. Ablation and user studies show that the debate and resultant explanations significantly improve detection performance and improve trust for both experts and non-experts, positioning MAD-Sherlock as a robust tool for autonomous citizen intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder.</p></details> | 16 pages,4 figures |

While interactions with AI have been shown to durably reduce people's beliefs in false information, it is unclear whether these interactions also teach people the skills to discern false information themselves. We conducted a month-long study where 67 participants classified news headline-image pairs as real or fake, discussed their assessments with an AI system, followed by an unassisted evaluation of unseen news items to measure accuracy before, during, and after AI assistance. While AI assistance produced immediate improvements during AI-assisted sessions (+21\% average), participants' unassisted performance on new items declined significantly by week 4 (-15.3\%). These results indicate that while AI may help immediately, it ultimately degrades long-term misinformation detection abilities.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of achieving explainable systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present \textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Interpreting such creator intent is therefore essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) and effective information governance. To this end, we introduce DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark of 12,000 image-caption pairs grounded in trustworthy reference articles, created using an intent-guided simulation framework that models both the desired influence and the execution plan of news creators. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading cases, spanning manipulations across visual and textual modalities, and supports three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) and find that they struggle with intent reasoning, often relying on shallow cues such as surface-level alignment, stylistic polish, or heuristic authenticity signals. These results highlight the limitations of current VLMs and position DeceptionDecoded as a foundation for developing intent-aware models that go beyond shallow cues in MMD.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current misinformation detection approaches implicitly assume that misinformation is static. We introduce MPCG, a multi-round, persona-conditioned framework that simulates how claims are iteratively reinterpreted by agents with distinct ideological perspectives. Our approach uses an uncensored large language model (LLM) to generate persona-specific claims across multiple rounds, conditioning each generation on outputs from the previous round, enabling the study of misinformation evolution. We evaluate the generated claims through human and LLM-based annotations, cognitive effort metrics (readability, perplexity), emotion evocation metrics (sentiment analysis, morality), clustering, feasibility, and downstream classification. Results show strong agreement between human and GPT-4o-mini annotations, with higher divergence in fluency judgments. Generated claims require greater cognitive effort than the original claims and consistently reflect persona-aligned emotional and moral framing. Clustering and cosine similarity analyses confirm semantic drift across rounds while preserving topical coherence. Feasibility results show a 77% feasibility rate, confirming suitability for downstream tasks. Classification results reveal that commonly used misinformation detectors experience macro-F1 performance drops of up to 49.7%.

While automated fact-checking has emerged as a viable solution, most current systems are limited to evaluating factual accuracy. However, the detrimental effect of misinformation transcends simple falsehoods; it takes advantage of how individuals perceive, interpret, and emotionally react to information. This underscores the need to move beyond factuality and adopt more human-centered detection frameworks. In this survey, we explore the evolving interplay between traditional fact-checking approaches and psychological concepts such as cognitive biases, social dynamics, and emotional responses. By analyzing state-of-the-art misinformation detection systems through the lens of human psychology and behavior, we reveal critical limitations of current methods and identify opportunities for improvement. Additionally, we outline future research directions aimed at creating more robust and adaptive frameworks, such as neuro-behavioural models that integrate technological factors with the complexities of human cognition and social influence. These approaches offer promising pathways to more effectively detect and mitigate the societal harms of misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP'25 Main</p></details> |

Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data, lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation (GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task, GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection and grounding.

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |

Our work is motivated by the limitations of current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, which predominantly focus on content explanations that elucidate the linguistic features and sentence structures of the misinformation. To address this limitation, we explore various explanations beyond content explanation, such as "social explanation" that considers the broader social context surrounding misinformation, as well as a "combined explanation" where both the content and social explanations are presented in scenarios that are either aligned or misaligned with each other. To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these AI explanations, we conduct two online crowdsourcing experiments in the COVID-19 (Study 1 on Prolific) and Politics domains (Study 2 on MTurk). Our results show that AI explanations are generally effective in aiding users to detect misinformation, with effectiveness significantly influenced by the alignment between content and social explanations. We also find that the order in which explanation types are presented - specifically, whether a content or social explanation comes first - can influence detection accuracy, with differences found between the COVID-19 and Political domains. This work contributes towards more effective design of AI explanations, fostering a deeper understanding of how different explanation types and their combinations influence misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at CSCW 2025</p></details> |

We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, such as text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure, until the victim classifier changes its decision. We perform (1) quantitative evaluation using various prompts, models and query limits, (2) targeted manual assessment of the generated text and (3) qualitative linguistic analysis. The results confirm the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a social welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and social welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track; switched to IEEE conference template</p></details> |

However, scaling up model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient use of computational resources.

To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

To address this gap, we introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2. Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management, and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over 11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the next generation of code-based research benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via two instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we define a new task that enables testing with varying memory size under two scenarios: single domain where memory and tasks are from the same category and cross-domain (e.g. memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Instruction Tuning LLMs with Competence-Aware Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13790v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient instruction tuning aims to enhance the ultimate performance of large language models (LLMs) trained on a given instruction dataset. Curriculum learning as a typical data organization strategy has shown preliminary effectiveness in instruction tuning. However, current curriculum tuning methods suffer from the curriculum rigidity, since they rely solely on static heuristic difficulty metrics. These methods fail to adapt to the evolving capabilities of models during training, resulting in a fixed and potentially sub-optimal learning trajectory. To address the issue, Competence-Aware Multi-Perspective cUrriculum inStruction tuning framework termed CAMPUS is proposed. CAMPUS offers several advantages: (1) Dynamic selection for sub-curriculum. (2) Competency-aware adjustment to the curriculum schedule. (3) Multiple difficulty-based scheduling. Extensive experiments prove the superior performance of CAMPUS, compared to other state-of-the-art baselines for efficient instruction tuning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mylittleriver/MedREK.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Abilities of Small LLMs with Cognitive Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09802v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need for training effective small reasoning models. A critical challenge is that small models possess different reasoning capacities and cognitive trajectories compared with their larger counterparts. Hence, directly distilling chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from large LRMs to smaller ones can sometimes be ineffective and often requires a substantial amount of annotated data. In this paper, we first introduce a novel Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV) system, designed for training smaller yet powerful LRMs. Our CRV system consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique tasks: (i) critiquing the CoT rationales according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. Building on the CRV system, we further propose the Cognitive Preference Optimization (CogPO) algorithm to continuously enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning their reasoning processes with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our CRV+CogPO framework, which outperforms other methods by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>emnlp...</summary><p>emnlp 2025 main conference</p></details> |

While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration. In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA family models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.1 on WikiText2. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract "vectors of variable variations" (e.g., "male" to "female") from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that this assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation, to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning, from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from expertly imitated ones.

However, their inherent vulnerabilities have led to significant financial losses. Traditional auditing methods, while essential, struggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and scale of smart contracts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating vulnerability detection, but their adoption is often limited by high computational costs. Although prior work has explored leveraging large models through agents or workflows, relatively little attention has been given to improving the performance of smaller, fine-tuned models--a critical factor for achieving both efficiency and data privacy. In this paper, we introduce HKT-SmartAudit, a framework for developing lightweight models optimized for smart contract auditing. It features a multi-stage knowledge distillation pipeline that integrates classical distillation, external domain knowledge, and reward-guided learning to transfer high-quality insights from large teacher models. A single-task learning strategy is employed to train compact student models that maintain high accuracy and robustness while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental results show that our distilled models outperform both commercial tools and larger models in detecting complex vulnerabilities and logical flaws, offering a practical, secure, and scalable solution for smart contract auditing.

However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://jayneelparekh.github.io/learn-to-steer/</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://github.com/Skilteee/DiZO.</p></details> |  |

Existing work probes when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA) prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open- and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues. Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally, building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.</p></details> |  |

Yet, whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements, and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning. The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/umbertocappellazzo/Llama-AVSR</p></details> |

However, deploying agentic LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems in production presents significant challenges, stemming from their inherently multi-stage computational dependencies, strict latency requirements, and the complexity of deployment across heterogeneous GPUs widely existing in enterprise clusters. Meanwhile, existing LLM serving frameworks are primarily designed for independent inference tasks, resulting in suboptimal performance and frequent service-level objective (SLO) violations in Text-to-SQL workloads. In this paper, we introduce HEXGEN-FLOW, a novel framework designed explicitly to schedule and execute agentic multi-stage LLM-based Text-to-SQL workflows on heterogeneous GPU clusters serving multi-tenant Text-to-SQL requests. HEXGEN-FLOW introduces a hierarchical scheduling approach that combines global workload-balanced task dispatching with an adaptive local priority queue, guided by a systematic analysis of agentic Text-to-SQL workflows. Additionally, we propose a lightweight simulation-based method for tuning critical scheduling hyperparameters, further enhancing robustness and adaptability. Our evaluation on realistic Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrates that HEXGEN-FLOW significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving frameworks. Across all traces, HEXGEN-FLOW reduces P95 tail latency by $1.42{\sim}1.56\times$ and increases throughput by $1.49{\sim}1.81\times$, demonstrating robust improvements under diverse workloads. Our code is available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/Hexgen-Flow.</p></details> |  |

LLM agents are now extensively applied across various domains, handling vast amounts of data to interact with humans and execute tasks. The widespread applications of LLM agents demonstrate their significant commercial value; however, they also expose security and privacy vulnerabilities. At the current stage, comprehensive research on the security and privacy of LLM agents is highly needed. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the newly emerged privacy and security issues faced by LLM agents. We begin by introducing the fundamental knowledge of LLM agents, followed by a categorization and analysis of the threats. We then discuss the impacts of these threats on humans, environment, and other agents. Subsequently, we review existing defensive strategies, and finally explore future trends. Additionally, the survey incorporates diverse case studies to facilitate a more accessible understanding. By highlighting these critical security and privacy issues, the survey seeks to stimulate future research towards enhancing the security and privacy of LLM agents, thereby increasing their reliability and trustworthiness in future applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 19 figures.

We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Curriculum Reinforcement Learning from Easy to Hard Tasks Improves LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06632v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H), allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs (1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. Our code can be found on https://github.com/divelab/E2H-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Strategic Reasoning: Agentic Study through Behavioral Game Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20432v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[SLIP: Securing LLMs IP Using Weights Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10886v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently seen widespread adoption in both academia and industry. As these models grow, they become valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting substantial investments by their owners. The high cost of cloud-based deployment has spurred interest in running models on edge devices, but this risks exposing parameters to theft and unauthorized use. Existing approaches to protect model IP on the edge trade off practicality, accuracy, or deployment requirements. We introduce SLIP, a hybrid inference algorithm designed to protect edge-deployed models from theft. SLIP is, to our knowledge, the first hybrid protocol that is both practical for real-world applications and provably secure, while incurring zero accuracy degradation and minimal latency overhead. It partitions the model across two computing resources: one secure but expensive, and one cost-effective but vulnerable. Using matrix decomposition, the secure resource retains the most sensitive portion of the model's IP while performing only a small fraction of the computation; the vulnerable resource executes the remainder. The protocol includes security guarantees that prevent attackers from using the partition to infer the protected information. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, positioning it as a compelling solution for protecting LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recognising, Anticipating, and Mitigating LLM Pollution of Online Behavioural Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01390v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together, these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc, and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts. As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural research.</p></details> |  |

We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages fine-grained cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves up to 9 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Features in Prompts Jailbreak LLMs? Investigating the Mechanisms Behind Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03343v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaks have been a central focus of research regarding the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms underlying these attacks remain poorly understood. While previous studies have predominantly relied on linear methods to detect jailbreak attempts and model refusals, we take a different approach by examining both linear and non-linear features in prompts that lead to successful jailbreaks. First, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,800 jailbreak attempts spanning 35 diverse attack methods. Leveraging this dataset, we train linear and non-linear probes on hidden states of open-weight LLMs to predict jailbreak success. Probes achieve strong in-distribution accuracy but transfer is attack-family-specific, revealing that different jailbreaks are supported by distinct internal mechanisms rather than a single universal direction. To establish causal relevance, we construct probe-guided latent interventions that systematically shift compliance in the predicted direction. Interventions derived from non-linear probes produce larger and more reliable effects than those from linear probes, indicating that features linked to jailbreak success are encoded non-linearly in prompt representations. Overall, the results surface heterogeneous, non-linear structure in jailbreak mechanisms and provide a prompt-side methodology for recovering and testing the features that drive jailbreak outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.</p></details> | 29 pages |

In this work, we explore whether autoregressive decoding is essential for such reconstruction. We show that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one token-parallel forward pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising and underexplored multi-token generation capability of autoregressive LLMs. We examine these embeddings and characterize the information they encode. We also empirically show that, although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form connected and local regions in embedding space - suggesting the potential to train a practical encoder. The existence of such representations hints that multi-token generation may be natively accessible in off-the-shelf LLMs via a learned input encoder, eliminating heavy retraining and helping to overcome the fundamental bottleneck of autoregressive decoding while reusing already-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to EMNLP2025 main</p></details> |

However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NeurIPS2025.

Existing MCP research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training. MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing 68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call generation, and enhanced agentic task performance. MCP-Flow thus provides a scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP environments.

| **[From Stochasticity to Signal: A Bayesian Latent State Model for Reliable Measurement with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23874v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate classification tasks in business, such as analyzing customer satisfaction from text. However, the inherent stochasticity of LLMs, in terms of their tendency to produce different outputs for the same input, creates a significant measurement error problem that is often neglected with a single round of output, or addressed with ad-hoc methods like majority voting. Such naive approaches fail to quantify uncertainty and can produce biased estimates of population-level metrics. In this paper, we propose a principled solution by reframing LLM variability as a statistical measurement error problem and introducing a Bayesian latent state model to address it. Our model treats the true classification (e.g., customer dissatisfaction) as an unobserved latent variable and the multiple LLM ratings as noisy measurements of this state. This framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the LLM's false positive and false negative error rates, the underlying base rate of the phenomenon in the population, the posterior probability of the true state for each individual observation, and the causal impact of a business intervention, if any, on the latent state. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our model accurately recovers true parameters where naive methods fail. We conclude that this methodology provides a general and reliable framework for converting noisy, probabilistic outputs from LLMs into accurate and actionable insights for scientific and business applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom is Knowing What not to Say: Hallucination-Free LLMs Unlearning via Attention Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17210v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs). Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

Existing NLRec approaches often use Dense Retrieval (DR) to compute item relevance scores from aggregation of inner products between user request embeddings and relevant passage embeddings. However, DR views the request as the sole relevance label, thus leading to a unimodal scoring function centered on the query embedding that is often a weak proxy for query relevance. To better capture the potential multimodal distribution of the relevance scoring function that may arise from complex NLRec data, we propose GPR-LLM that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with LLM relevance judgments for a subset of candidate passages. Experiments on four NLRec datasets and two LLM backbones demonstrate that GPR-LLM with an RBF kernel, capable of modeling multimodal relevance scoring functions, consistently outperforms simpler unimodal kernels (dot product, cosine similarity), as well as baseline methods including DR, cross-encoder, and pointwise LLM-based relevance scoring by up to 65%. Overall, GPR-LLM provides an efficient and effective approach to NLRec within a minimal LLM labeling budget.</p></details> | 16 pages,20 figures |

We attribute this to subjective evaluation criteria combined with Likert scale scoring in existing protocols. To address this issue, we introduce CheckEval, a checklist-based evaluation framework that improves rating reliability via decomposed binary questions. Through experiments with 12 evaluator models across multiple datasets, we first demonstrate that CheckEval strongly correlates with human judgments. More importantly, CheckEval dramatically improves the average agreement across evaluator models by 0.45 and reduces the score variance. CheckEval scores furthermore have the benefit of being more interpretable because it decomposes evaluation criteria into traceable binary decisions, allowing analyses of specific attributes driving quality judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

| **[Do LLM Evaluators Prefer Themselves for a Reason?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03846v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators in applications like benchmarking, reward modeling, and self-refinement. Prior work highlights a potential self-preference bias where LLMs favor their own generated responses, a tendency often intensifying with model size and capability. This raises a critical question: Is self-preference harmful, or does it simply reflect the genuinely higher-quality outputs of stronger models? Answering this has been difficult as previous studies relied primarily on subjective tasks. These tasks lack an objective ground truth, meaning that either preference can be reasonably justified. To address this ambiguity, we investigate self-preference using verifiable benchmarks (mathematical reasoning, factual knowledge, code generation) that allow objective ground-truth assessment. This enables us to distinguish harmful self-preference (favoring objectively worse responses) from legitimate self-preference (favoring genuinely superior ones). We conduct large-scale experiments under controlled evaluation conditions across diverse model families (e.g., Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Mistral, Phi, GPT, DeepSeek). Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) While stronger models exhibit greater self-preference, much of this preference aligns with objectively superior performance, indicating stronger models prefer themselves mostly legitimately. (2) Harmful self-preference persists when evaluator models err as generators, and stronger models display more pronounced harmful self-preference when they do err. This suggests stronger models struggle more to recognize when they are wrong. (3) Inference-time scaling strategies, such as generating a long Chain-of-Thought before evaluation, effectively reduce harmful self-preference. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of LLM-based evaluation and practical insights for improving its reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, many realworld workloads such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Ninth Annual Conference on Machine Learning and Systems (MLSys'26)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Pointwise Scores: Decomposed Criteria-Based Evaluation of LLM Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16093v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating long-form answers in high-stakes domains such as law or medicine remains a fundamental challenge. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture semantic correctness, and current LLM-based evaluators often reduce nuanced aspects of answer quality into a single undifferentiated score. We introduce DeCE, a decomposed LLM evaluation framework that separates precision (factual accuracy and relevance) and recall (coverage of required concepts), using instance-specific criteria automatically extracted from gold answer requirements. DeCE is model-agnostic and domain-general, requiring no predefined taxonomies or handcrafted rubrics. We instantiate DeCE to evaluate different LLMs on a real-world legal QA task involving multi-jurisdictional reasoning and citation grounding. DeCE achieves substantially stronger correlation with expert judgments ($r=0.78$), compared to traditional metrics ($r=0.12$), pointwise LLM scoring ($r=0.35$), and modern multidimensional evaluators ($r=0.48$). It also reveals interpretable trade-offs: generalist models favor recall, while specialized models favor precision. Importantly, only 11.95% of LLM-generated criteria required expert revision, underscoring DeCE's scalability. DeCE offers an interpretable and actionable LLM evaluation framework in expert domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 EMNLP industry track</p></details> |
| **[On Selecting Few-Shot Examples for LLM-based Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27675v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for many coding tasks, including summarization, translation, completion, and code generation. However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task for LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning (ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct answers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However, choosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model performance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot examples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first criterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a sample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about its usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity of the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples based on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations to determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under various combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RDMA Point-to-Point Communication for LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27656v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) system patterns, such as disaggregated inference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing, and asynchronous reinforcement fine-tuning, require flexible point-to-point communication beyond simple collectives. Existing implementations are locked to specific Network Interface Controllers (NICs), hindering integration into inference engines and portability across hardware providers. We present TransferEngine, which bridges the functionality of common NICs to expose a uniform interface. TransferEngine exposes one-sided WriteImm operations with a ImmCounter primitive for completion notification, without ordering assumptions of network transport, transparently managing multiple NICs per GPU. We demonstrate peak throughput of 400 Gbps on both NVIDIA ConnectX-7 and AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). We showcase TransferEngine through three production systems: (1) KvCache transfer for disaggregated inference with dynamic scaling, (2) RL weight updates achieving 1.3 seconds for trillion-parameter models, and (3) MoE dispatch/combine implementation exceeding DeepEP decode latency on ConnectX-7, with the first viable latencies on EFA. We demonstrate that our portable point-to-point communication complements collectives while avoiding lock-in.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORGEval: Graph-Theoretic Evaluation of LLMs in Optimization Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27610v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism. Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even leading reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[HELIOS: Adaptive Model And Early-Exit Selection for Efficient LLM Inference Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10724v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-Exit Large Language Models (EE-LLMs) enable high throughput inference by allowing tokens to exit early at intermediate layers. However, their throughput is limited by the computational and memory savings. Existing EE-LLM frameworks rely on a single model and therefore, their token generation latencies are bottlenecked by tokens that do not exit early and traverse additional layers. Moreover, early exits are only known at runtime and depend on the request. Therefore, these frameworks load the weights of all model layers even though large portions remain unused when tokens exit early. The lack of memory savings limit us from scaling the batch sizes. We propose $\textit{HELIOS}$, a framework that improves both token generation latency and batch sizes to enable high-throughput in EE-LLMs. HELIOS exploits two insights. $\textit{First}$, early exits are often complimentary across models, tokens that do not exit early on one model often take an early-exit on another. HELIOS employs multiple models and dynamically switches between them to collectively maximize the number of tokens that exit early, and minimize token generation latencies. $\textit{Second}$, even when a predicted token does not exit early due to poor confidence, it often remains unchanged even after additional layer traversal. HELIOS greedily allows such tokens to exit early and only loads the weights of the most likely to be used layers, yielding memory savings which is then re-purposed to increase batch sizes. HELIOS employs real-time profiling to accurately identify the early-exit distributions, and adaptively switches between models by tracking tokens in real-time to minimize the performance degradation caused by greedy model loading and exiting. Our evaluations show that HELIOS achieves $1.48\times$ higher throughput and $15.14\times$ larger batch size compared to existing EE-LLM frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Domain Adaptation for LLM-based MT using Contrastive Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27556v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards. Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Independent Clinical Evaluation of General-Purpose LLM Responses to Signals of Suicide Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27521v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce findings and methods to facilitate evidence-based discussion about how large language models (LLMs) should behave in response to user signals of risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). People are already using LLMs as mental health resources, and several recent incidents implicate LLMs in mental health crises. Despite growing attention, few studies have been able to effectively generalize clinical guidelines to LLM use cases, and fewer still have proposed methodologies that can be iteratively applied as knowledge improves about the elements of human-AI interaction most in need of study. We introduce an assessment of LLM alignment with guidelines for ethical communication, adapted from clinical principles and applied to expressions of risk factors for STB in multi-turn conversations. Using a codebook created and validated by clinicians, mobilizing the volunteer participation of practicing therapists and trainees (N=43) based in the U.S., and using generalized linear mixed-effects models for statistical analysis, we assess a single fully open-source LLM, OLMo-2-32b. We show how to assess when a model deviates from clinically informed guidelines in a way that may pose a hazard and (thanks to its open nature) facilitates future investigation as to why. We find that contrary to clinical best practice, OLMo-2-32b, and, possibly by extension, other LLMs, will become less likely to invite continued dialog as users send more signals of STB risk in multi-turn settings. We also show that OLMo-2-32b responds differently depending on the risk factor expressed. This empirical evidence highlights that just as chatbots pose hazards if their responses reinforce delusions or assist in suicidal acts, they may also discourage further help-seeking or cause feelings of dismissal or abandonment by withdrawing from conversations when STB risk is expressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auditing LLM Editorial Bias in News Media Exposure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27489v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly act as gateways to web content, shaping how millions of users encounter online information. Unlike traditional search engines, whose retrieval and ranking mechanisms are well studied, the selection processes of web-connected LLMs add layers of opacity to how answers are generated. By determining which news outlets users see, these systems can influence public opinion, reinforce echo chambers, and pose risks to civic discourse and public trust. This work extends two decades of research in algorithmic auditing to examine how LLMs function as news engines. We present the first audit comparing three leading agents, GPT-4o-Mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, against Google News, asking: \textit{How do LLMs differ from traditional aggregators in the diversity, ideology, and reliability of the media they expose to users?} Across 24 global topics, we find that, compared to Google News, LLMs surface significantly fewer unique outlets and allocate attention more unevenly. In the same way, GPT-4o-Mini emphasizes more factual and right-leaning sources; Claude-3.7-Sonnet favors institutional and civil-society domains and slightly amplifies right-leaning exposure; and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibits a modest left-leaning tilt without significant changes in factuality. These patterns remain robust under prompt variations and alternative reliability benchmarks. Together, our findings show that LLMs already enact \textit{agentic editorial policies}, curating information in ways that diverge from conventional aggregators. Understanding and governing their emerging editorial power will be critical for ensuring transparency, pluralism, and trust in digital information ecosystems.</p></details> | Under Peer Review |

In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.</p></details> |  |

At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation - referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date. We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) - within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations - one token order above, but within the model's context window - outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, LaTeX; repository URL updated, typos corrected</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms behind these phenomena. First, we demonstrate that RLVR struggles to improve capability as it focuses on improving the accuracy of the easier questions to the detriment of the accuracy of the most difficult questions. Second, we show that RLVR does not merely increase the success probability for the easier questions, but in our small model settings, produces quality responses that were absent in its original output distribution. In addition, we show these responses are neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords, underscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third, from the experiment distilling teacher responses to in-distribution problems, we find that capability does not always improve with distillation. We conjecture that capability improves only when new knowledge is introduced, whereas distilling reasoning patterns only improves accuracy but not capability, sacrificing performance on the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these findings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape reasoning behavior in LLMs</p></details> | 25 pages |

Ensuring their reliability demands automated test suites that exercise diverse and boundary level behaviors. Nevertheless, designing such test cases remains a challenging and resource intensive endeavor. This study extends prior work on Large Language Model (LLM) based test amplification by evaluating single agent and multi agent configurations across four additional cloud applications. The amplified test suites maintain semantic validity with minimal human intervention. The results demonstrate that agentic LLM systems can effectively generalize across heterogeneous API architectures, increasing endpoint and parameter coverage while revealing defects. Moreover, a detailed analysis of computational cost, runtime, and energy consumption highlights trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of LLM driven test amplification to advance the automation and sustainability of REST API testing in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Knowledge Updates: Toward Unified Modular Editing in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27400v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing. This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an optimal range across diverse settings.</p></details> |  |

Bias and Performance Gaps in Multilingual LLMs Across Language Families and Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07877v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation (MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs.

Unlike previous works that manipulate the hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration. In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them, achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 main conference</p></details> |

This claim was motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

The paradigm of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6 previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation models.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

A Study Based on Pseudocode](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00920v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in code translation. However, accurate translation remains challenging when using the commonly adopted direct code-to-code translation approach, which converts a program into the target programming language (PL) in a single step. Inspired by the success of incorporating intermediate steps to guide LLMs in resolving challenging tasks, we explore pseudocode-based code translation, which emulates the human semantic translation by first interpreting the program's intent and logic into pseudocode and then implementing it in the target PL. We find that pseudocode-based translation helps translate programs that direct translation struggles to handle. Nonetheless, the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of this approach remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present an empirical study on pseudocode-based code translation, aiming to investigate its effectiveness in enhancing the direct translation approach, illuminate its effective usage, and identify limitations hindering its potential benefits. By comparing direct and pseudocode-based translation approaches on 9,690 translation tasks across six PLs with five popular LLMs, we demonstrate that pseudocode-based translation can effectively complement direct translation, particularly when translating from flexible to rigid PLs or dealing with low-resource Rust. Based on these findings, we suggest adopting strategies that combine the complementary strengths of both approaches to enhance code translation accuracy. We also reveal the advantages of pseudocode-based translation in disentangling translations of complicated programs and mitigating distractions from detailed implementations in original programs, as well as its limitations due to incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous pseudocode.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |

However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench -- the first comprehensive benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments, covering both explicit and implicit hazards. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 9 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness. Dataset and codes are available in https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/safeagentbench/SafeAgentBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 19 tables, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Guided Scenario-based GUI Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05079v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assurance of mobile app GUIs has become increasingly important, as the GUI serves as the primary medium of interaction between users and apps. Although numerous automated GUI testing approaches have been developed with diverse strategies, a substantial gap remains between these approaches and the underlying app business logic. Most existing approaches focus on general exploration rather than the completion of specific testing scenarios, often missing critical functionalities. Inspired by manual testing, which treats business logic-driven scenarios as the fundamental unit of testing, this paper introduces an approach that leverages large language models to comprehend GUI semantics and contextual relevance to given scenarios. Building on this capability, we propose ScenGen, an LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing framework employing multi-agent collaboration to simulate and automate manual testing phases. Specifically, ScenGen integrates five agents: the Observer, Decider, Executor, Supervisor, and Recorder. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by extracting and structuring GUI widgets and layouts, interpreting semantic information. This is passed to the Decider, which makes scenario-driven decisions with LLM guidance to identify target widgets and determine actions toward fulfilling specific goals. The Executor performs these operations, while the Supervisor verifies alignment with intended scenario completion, ensuring traceability and consistency. Finally, the Recorder logs GUI operations into context memory as a knowledge base for subsequent decision-making and monitors runtime bugs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ScenGen effectively generates scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLM collaboration, achieving higher relevance to business logic and improving the completeness of automated GUI testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond a Million Tokens: Benchmarking and Enhancing Long-Term Memory in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27246v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations, accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities. From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and 2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each memory component.</p></details> |  |

ATS has drawn considerable interest in both academic and industrial circles. Many studies have been conducted in the past to survey ATS methods; however, they generally lack practicality for real-world implementations, as they often categorize previous methods from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has altered conventional ATS methods. In this survey, we aim to 1) provide a comprehensive overview of ATS from a ``Process-Oriented Schema'' perspective, which is best aligned with real-world implementations; 2) comprehensively review the latest LLM-based ATS works; and 3) deliver an up-to-date survey of ATS, bridging the two-year gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to specifically investigate LLM-based ATS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Reasoning Capabilities in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03865v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods, including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency, excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths. Implementation is available at https://github.com/KounianhuaDu/Fints.</p></details> |  |

While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation.

This workload creates severe performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake, a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring the Security of Mobile LLM Agents under Adversarial Prompts from Untrusted Third-Party Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27140v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development, enabling AI-powered applications known as LLM-based agents that promise to automate tasks across diverse apps and workflows. Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiagramEval: Evaluating LLM-Generated Diagrams via Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25761v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams, sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in extracting attributes of structured tables from unstructured data, researchers are developing LLM-powered data systems for users to analyze unstructured documents as working with a database. These unstructured data analysis (UDA) systems differ significantly in all aspects, including query interfaces, query optimization strategies, and operator implementations, making it unclear which performs best in which scenario. Unfortunately, there does not exist a comprehensive benchmark that offers high-quality, large-volume, and diverse datasets as well as rich query workload to thoroughly evaluate such systems. To fill this gap, we present UDA-Bench, the first benchmark for unstructured data analysis that meets all the above requirements. Specifically, we organize a team with 30 graduate students that spends over in total 10,000 hours on curating 5 datasets from various domains and constructing a relational database view from these datasets by manual annotation. These relational databases can be used as ground truth to evaluate any of these UDA systems despite their differences in programming interfaces. Moreover, we design diverse queries to analyze the attributes defined in the database schema, covering different types of analytical operators with varying selectivities and complexities. We conduct in-depth analysis of the key building blocks of existing UDA systems: query interface, query optimization, operator design, and data processing. We run exhaustive experiments over the benchmark to fully evaluate these systems and different techniques w.r.t. the above building blocks.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates personal medical documents into LLMs by an external retrievable database to address the costly retraining or fine-tuning issues in deploying customized agents. While deploying medical agents in edge devices ensures privacy protection, RAG implementations impose substantial memory access and energy consumption during the retrieval stage. This paper presents a hierarchical retrieval architecture for edge RAG, leveraging a two-stage retrieval scheme that combines approximate retrieval for candidate set generation, followed by high-precision retrieval on pre-selected document embeddings. The proposed architecture significantly reduces energy consumption and external memory access while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Simulation results show that, under TSMC 28nm technology, the proposed hierarchical retrieval architecture has reduced the overall memory access by nearly 50% and the computation by 75% compared to pure INT8 retrieval, and the total energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 {\mu}J/query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BioCAS2025</p></details> |

Lately, using large language models (LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case, making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In this paper we propose a method to perform instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.</p></details> |  |

Trainium, an AI accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to the Proceedings of the Twenty-First European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys'26)</p></details> |

While self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math reasoning through self-play.</p></details> |  |

Conversations shared with these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate, privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Big Data 2025</p></details> |

Alternatively, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

We study how well LLMs construct confidence intervals around their own answers and find that they are systematically overconfident. To evaluate this behavior, we introduce FermiEval, a benchmark of Fermi-style estimation questions with a rigorous scoring rule for confidence interval coverage and sharpness. Across several modern models, nominal 99\% intervals cover the true answer only 65\% of the time on average. With a conformal prediction based approach that adjusts the intervals, we obtain accurate 99\% observed coverage, and the Winkler interval score decreases by 54\%. We also propose direct log-probability elicitation and quantile adjustment methods, which further reduce overconfidence at high confidence levels. Finally, we develop a perception-tunnel theory explaining why LLMs exhibit overconfidence: when reasoning under uncertainty, they act as if sampling from a truncated region of their inferred distribution, neglecting its tails.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy, low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking} phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce \textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods, our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%, establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in securing IoT, enabling attack detection, attack behavior analysis, and mitigation suggestion. Despite advancements, evaluations remain purely qualitative, and the lack of a standardized, objective benchmark for quantitatively measuring AI-based attack analysis and mitigation hinders consistent assessment of model effectiveness. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) for multi-class attack detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion. After benchmarking several ML and Deep Learning (DL) classifiers on the Edge-IIoTset and CICIoT2023 datasets, we applied structured role-play prompt engineering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to guide ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 in producing detailed, context-aware responses. We introduce novel evaluation metrics for quantitative assessment to guide us and an ensemble of judge LLMs, namely ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta Llama 4, TII Falcon H1 34B Instruct, xAI Grok 3, and Claude 4 Sonnet, to independently evaluate the responses. Results show that Random Forest has the best detection model, and ChatGPT-o3 outperformed DeepSeek-R1 in attack analysis and mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Human Verification of LLM Reasoning through Interactive Explanation Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22922v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their increasing employment in several critical applications, particularly education, where they support problem-solving, tutoring, and personalized study. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities [1, 2] are well-known to help LLMs decompose a problem into steps and explore the solution spaces more effectively, leading to impressive performance on mathematical and reasoning benchmarks. As the length of CoT tokens per question increases substantially to even thousands of tokens per question [ 1], it is unknown how users could comprehend LLM reasoning and detect errors or hallucinations. To address this problem and understand how reasoning can improve human-AI interaction, we present three new interactive reasoning interfaces: interactive CoT (iCoT), interactive Program-of-Thought (iPoT), and interactive Graph (iGraph). That is, we ask LLMs themselves to generate an interactive web interface wrapped around the original CoT content, which may be presented in text (iCoT), graphs (iGraph) or code (iPoT). This interface allows users to interact with and provide a novel experience in reading and validating the reasoning chains of LLMs. Across a study of 125 participants, interactive interfaces significantly improve user performance. Specifically, iGraph users score the highest error detection rate (85.6%), followed by iPoT (82.5%), iCoT (80.6%), all outperforming standard CoT (73.5%). Interactive interfaces also lead to faster user validation time-iGraph users are faster (57.9 secs per question) than the users of iCoT and iPoT (60 secs) and the standard CoT (64.7 secs). A post-study questionnaire shows that users prefer iGraph, citing its superior ability to enable them to follow the LLM's reasoning. We discuss the implications of these results and provide recommendations for the future design of reasoning models.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

To cope with this shift, we propose FlowMesh, a multi-tenant service fabric that executes and optimizes these workloads as one shared service instead of isolated pipelines. It decomposes workflows into fine-grained operators with recorded lineage, enabling de-duplication of work across users and batching requests on the same hardware while preserving per-workflow provenance. A global control plane maintains a cluster-wide pool of ready operators and uses a single utility function to pick both the batch and the worker, balancing throughput, cost, and data locality on heterogeneous GPUs. The data plane is an elastic fleet of stateless workers backed by a content-addressable store, enabling rapid, automatic scale-out, safe retry after preemption, and portability across managed clusters such as Kubernetes and geo-distributed GPU marketplaces such as Vast.ai.

These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability. Existing methodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to address such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token. This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original pathologies are resolved. Finally, we outline the architectural implications of our framework, arguing for a paradigm shift from static look-ups to dynamic, geometrically-grounded computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Multi...</summary><p>Multiple senior math professors pointed out technical flaws of this work, i.e., weak connection between the proposed work and LLM applications.

| **[LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic "filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections, presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional programming patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data at https://filter.baulab.info/</p></details> |
| **[Comparing human and LLM politeness strategies in free production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09391v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models ($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about pragmatic alignment in AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures | EMNLP 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

We trained a wide range of base models on a variety of datasets including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and general-domain tasks, resulting in 1,000+ SFT models under controlled conditions. We then identified the dataset properties that matter most and examined the layer-wise modifications introduced by SFT. Our findings reveal that some training-task synergies persist across all models while others vary substantially, emphasizing the importance of model-specific strategies. Moreover, we demonstrate that perplexity consistently predicts SFT effectiveness, often surpassing superficial similarity between the training data and the benchmark, and that mid-layer weight changes correlate most strongly with performance gains. We release these 1,000+ SFT models and benchmark results to accelerate further research.

| **[Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26707v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems. Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation, as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemAscend: System Memory Optimization for SSD-Offloaded LLM Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23254v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to the huge success of generative artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a core subclass, underpinning applications such as question answering, text generation, and code completion. While fine-tuning these models on domain-specific data can yield significant performance gains, it also poses daunting computational challenges, especially for researchers and small organizations with limited hardware resources. Although SSD offloading (i.e., ZeRO-Infinity) has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome the GPU memory barrier via leveraging both system memory (i.e., CPU DRAM) and storage space (i.e., solid-state devices, SSDs), its design primarily targets model-centric performance issues. As a result, key system-level issues, including system memory fragmentation, inefficient pinned buffer allocation, peak CPU usage spikes, and file system overhead, remain unaddressed, stifling scalability and inflating costs. Such an observation motivates this paper to introduce MemAscend, a framework that systematically tackles the underexplored system memory bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training, with a focus on resource-constrained environments. By streamlining pinned-memory allocation, eradicating fragmentation, and mitigating peak overhead, MemAscend reclaims a substantial system memory budget, enabling larger models, longer context windows, and higher batch sizes without exceeding modest hardware limits. Across diverse LLM benchmarks, MemAscend reduces peak system-memory consumption by an average of 55.7% compared with standard SSD offloading techniques, lowering the hardware barrier for fine-tuning and unlocking new possibilities for cost-effective large-scale training on limited-resource machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 21 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Analysis and Optimized CXL-Attached Memory Allocation for Long-Context LLM Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03305v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial memory requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for long-context fine-tuning, have renewed interest in CPU offloading to augment limited GPU memory. However, as context lengths grow, relying on CPU memory for intermediate states introduces a significant bottleneck that can exhaust the capacity of mainstream client platforms. To address this limitation, this work investigates the effectiveness of Compute Express Link (CXL) add-in card (AIC) memory as an extension to CPU memory, enabling larger model sizes and longer context lengths during fine-tuning. Extensive benchmarking reveals two critical challenges. First, current deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch lack fine-grained, per-tensor control over NUMA memory allocation, exposing only coarse, process-level policies. Second, due to this lack of control, when the memory footprint of fine-tuning is offloaded across local DRAM and CXL-attached memory, naively placing optimizer data in higher-latency CXL leads to substantial slowdowns in the optimizer step (e.g., 4x once data exceeds 20M elements). To overcome these challenges, this work introduces a PyTorch extension that enables tensor-level system memory control and a CXL-aware memory allocator that pins latency-critical tensors in local DRAM while maximizing bandwidth by striping latency-tolerant tensors across one or more CXL devices. Evaluated on a real hardware setup with 7B and 12B models, 4K-32K contexts, and a single GPU, our approach recovers throughput to 97-99% of DRAM-only with a single AIC and approximately 100% with two AICs, delivering up to 21% improvement over naive interleaving while preserving DRAM-like DMA bandwidth for GPU transfers. These results show that carefully managed CXL-attached memory is a practical path to scaling long-context fine-tuning beyond DRAM limits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Refine-n-Judge: Curating High-Quality Preference Chains for LLM-Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01543v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4. Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval 2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompoST: A Benchmark for Analyzing the Ability of LLMs To Compositionally Interpret Questions in a QALD Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21257v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts. Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they "understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research Track, 24th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2025), November 2-6, 2025, Nara, Japan</p></details> |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17197v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.</p></details> |  |

| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v6)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04173v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) is a declarative language for defining AI agents and workflows in a way that is compatible across different AI frameworks, promoting portability and interoperability within AI Agent frameworks. Agent Spec aims to resolve the challenges of fragmented agent development by providing a common unified specification that allows AI agents to be designed once and deployed across various frameworks, improving interoperability and reusability, while reducing redundant efforts. Additionally, Agent Spec facilitates development tools and portability, allowing AI agents to be defined independently of their execution environment and enabling teams to exchange solutions without implementation-specific limitations. Agent Spec benefits four key groups: (i) Agent developers, who gain a superset of reusable components and design patterns, enabling them to leverage a broader range of functionalities; (ii) Agent framework and tool developers, who can use Agent Spec as an interchange format and therefore benefit from cross-framework and tool support; (iii) Researchers, who can achieve reproducible results and comparability, facilitating more reliable and consistent outcomes; (iv) Enterprises, which see faster prototype-to-deployment, increased productivity, and greater scalability and maintainability for their AI agent solutions. This technical report provides an overview of the technical foundations of Agent Spec, including motivation, benefits, and future work. We also introduce a standardized Evaluation harness to assess agent behavior and agentic workflows across runtimes (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and WayFlow), using three different benchmarks (SimpleQA Verified, $\tau^2$-Bench and BIRD-SQL) - analogous to how HELM and related harnesses standardized LLM evaluation - so that performance, robustness, and efficiency can be compared consistently across frameworks.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2. Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management, and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over 11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the next generation of code-based research benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interaction as Intelligence Part II: Asynchronous Human-Agent Rollout for Long-Horizon Task Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27630v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering. Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5 model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via two instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, the accelerating volume and fragmentation of multi-sphere knowledge and data have surpassed human analytical capacity. This creates a major bottleneck for discovery, especially in climate science. To address this challenge, we introduce EarthLink, the first self-evolving AI agent system designed as an interactive "copilot" for Earth scientists. Through natural language interaction, EarthLink automates the entire research workflow by integrating planning, code execution, data analysis, and physical reasoning into a unified process that directly addresses this limitation. Beyond efficiency, it exhibits human-like cross-disciplinary analytical ability and achieves proficiency comparable to a junior researcher in expert evaluations on core large-scale climate tasks, including model-observation comparison and climate change understanding. When tasked with an open scientific problem, specifically the discovery of precursors of the Atlantic Ni\~no, EarthLink autonomously developed a research strategy, identified sources of predictability, verified its hypotheses with available data, and proposed a physically consistent mechanism. These emerging capabilities enable a new human-AI research paradigm. Scientists can focus on value and result judgments, while AI systems handle complex data analysis and knowledge integration. This accelerates the pace and breadth of discovery in Earth sciences. The system is accessible at our website https://earthlink.intern-ai.org.cn.</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical knowledge-execution gap: retrieved knowledge often fails to translate into effective real-world task execution. Our analysis shows even 90% correct knowledge yields only 41% execution success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose UI-Evol, a plug-and-play module for autonomous GUI knowledge evolution. UI-Evol consists of two stages: a Retrace Stage that extracts faithful objective action sequences from actual agent-environment interactions, and a Critique Stage that refines existing knowledge by comparing these sequences against external references. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the OSWorld benchmark with the state-of-the-art Agent S2. Our results demonstrate that UI-Evol not only significantly boosts task performance but also addresses a previously overlooked issue of high behavioral standard deviation in computer use agents, leading to superior performance on computer use tasks and substantially improved agent reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 Workshop on Computer Use Agents</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery (DVD) agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Unlike previous video agents that rely on predefined workflows applied uniformly across different queries, our approach emphasizes the autonomous and adaptive nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools to orchestrate adaptive workflow for different queries in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates our advantage. Our DVD agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging LVBench dataset, reaching an accuracy of 74.2%, which substantially surpasses all prior works, and further improves to 76.0% with transcripts.

| **[MARFT: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16129v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new MG called Flex-MG, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Conventional planning methods often overlook the presence of other agents, which can result in conflicts. In response, this article introduces the A$^*_+$T algorithm, a distributed approach that improves coordination among agents by anticipating their positions based on their movement speeds. The algorithm also considers dynamic obstacles, assessing potential collisions with respect to observed speeds and trajectories, thereby facilitating collision-free path planning in environments populated by other agents and moving objects. It incorporates a risk layer surrounding both dynamic and static entities, enhancing its utility in real-world applications. Each agent functions autonomously while being mindful of the paths chosen by others, effectively addressing the complexities inherent in multi-agent situations. The performance of A$^*_+$T has been rigorously tested in the Gazebo simulation environment and benchmarked against established approaches such as CBS, ECBS, and SIPP. Furthermore, the algorithm has shown competence in single-agent experiments, with results demonstrating its effectiveness in managing dynamic obstacles and affirming its practical relevance across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, 2 tabels, submited to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Language-Driven Coordination and Learning in Multi-Agent Simulation Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Large Language Models for Conceptual Systems Engineering and Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08619v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction, functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1 70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility, workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage remained minimal (less than 20%). Code compatibility peaked at 100% under specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50% for MAS. Only the reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes) whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.</p></details> | 32 pages, 4 figures |
| **[HEXGEN-FLOW: Optimizing LLM Inference Request Scheduling for Agentic Text-to-SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05286v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in leveraging the agentic paradigm of large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved Text-to-SQL capabilities, empowering users without specialized database knowledge to intuitively query databases. However, deploying agentic LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems in production presents significant challenges, stemming from their inherently multi-stage computational dependencies, strict latency requirements, and the complexity of deployment across heterogeneous GPUs widely existing in enterprise clusters. Meanwhile, existing LLM serving frameworks are primarily designed for independent inference tasks, resulting in suboptimal performance and frequent service-level objective (SLO) violations in Text-to-SQL workloads. In this paper, we introduce HEXGEN-FLOW, a novel framework designed explicitly to schedule and execute agentic multi-stage LLM-based Text-to-SQL workflows on heterogeneous GPU clusters serving multi-tenant Text-to-SQL requests. HEXGEN-FLOW introduces a hierarchical scheduling approach that combines global workload-balanced task dispatching with an adaptive local priority queue, guided by a systematic analysis of agentic Text-to-SQL workflows. Additionally, we propose a lightweight simulation-based method for tuning critical scheduling hyperparameters, further enhancing robustness and adaptability. Our evaluation on realistic Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrates that HEXGEN-FLOW significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving frameworks. Across all traces, HEXGEN-FLOW reduces P95 tail latency by $1.42{\sim}1.56\times$ and increases throughput by $1.49{\sim}1.81\times$, demonstrating robust improvements under diverse workloads. Our code is available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/Hexgen-Flow.</p></details> |  |

LLM agents are now extensively applied across various domains, handling vast amounts of data to interact with humans and execute tasks. The widespread applications of LLM agents demonstrate their significant commercial value; however, they also expose security and privacy vulnerabilities. At the current stage, comprehensive research on the security and privacy of LLM agents is highly needed. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the newly emerged privacy and security issues faced by LLM agents. We begin by introducing the fundamental knowledge of LLM agents, followed by a categorization and analysis of the threats. We then discuss the impacts of these threats on humans, environment, and other agents. Subsequently, we review existing defensive strategies, and finally explore future trends. Additionally, the survey incorporates diverse case studies to facilitate a more accessible understanding. By highlighting these critical security and privacy issues, the survey seeks to stimulate future research towards enhancing the security and privacy of LLM agents, thereby increasing their reliability and trustworthiness in future applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 19 figures.

| **[Experience-Driven Exploration for Efficient API-Free AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15259v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences, they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex, open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyMAC: Cascading Flexible Multi-Agent Collaboration via Next-Agent Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17784v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2) Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while substantially reducing communication overhead.</p></details> | EMNLP Main 2025 |
| **[LLM Strategic Reasoning: Agentic Study through Behavioral Game Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20432v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks. SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://slideagent.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper presents 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through temperament-based Patient Agent and evaluates diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality via Assessor Agent. It includes 2996 cases across 34 diagnoses from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for widely used open and closed-source LVLMs. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional neural network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%.

However, real-world deployment faces challenges due to bandwidth constraints and inevitable calibration errors during information exchange. To address these issues, we propose mmCooper, a novel multi-agent, multi-stage, communication-efficient, and collaboration-robust cooperative perception framework. Our framework leverages a multi-stage collaboration strategy that dynamically and adaptively balances intermediate- and late-stage information to share among agents, enhancing perceptual performance while maintaining communication efficiency. To support robust collaboration despite potential misalignments and calibration errors, our framework prevents misleading low-confidence sensing information from transmission and refines the received detection results from collaborators to improve accuracy. The extensive evaluation results on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the mmCooper framework and its components.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-NeiFi: Non-Invasive and Consensus-Efficient Multi-Agent Opinion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13370v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.</p></details> |  |
| **[KVCOMM: Online Cross-context KV-cache Communication for Efficient LLM-based Multi-agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12872v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NeurIPS2025.

Existing MCP research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training. MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing 68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call generation, and enhanced agentic task performance. MCP-Flow thus provides a scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP environments.

The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming computers into contextual environments that language models can natively comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments for language models represents a promising direction for developing more capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with digital systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves 15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives without requiring costly training.</p></details> |  |

However, current retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive problem-solving.

As agents increasingly consume these services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely volume based or semantic methods.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Asynchronous Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Packet Routing for Ultra-Dense LEO Satellite Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27506v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous network environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and significant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing algorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse and often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However, existing methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on impractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To tackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing framework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on its own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case performance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved by enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS objectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO constellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively optimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious baseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms end-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by resolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion avoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust routing.</p></details> |  |

At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation - referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date. We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) - within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations - one token order above, but within the model's context window - outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, LaTeX; repository URL updated, typos corrected</p></details> |
| **[From Pixels to Paths: A Multi-Agent Framework for Editable Scientific Illustration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27452v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and post-editability. However, current generative models have two major limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol. VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception, and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models, presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of illustrations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Affective Memory Management for Personalized LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27418v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects. Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of long-term memory systems.</p></details> | 12 pasges, 8 figures |

Ensuring their reliability demands automated test suites that exercise diverse and boundary level behaviors. Nevertheless, designing such test cases remains a challenging and resource intensive endeavor. This study extends prior work on Large Language Model (LLM) based test amplification by evaluating single agent and multi agent configurations across four additional cloud applications. The amplified test suites maintain semantic validity with minimal human intervention. The results demonstrate that agentic LLM systems can effectively generalize across heterogeneous API architectures, increasing endpoint and parameter coverage while revealing defects. Moreover, a detailed analysis of computational cost, runtime, and energy consumption highlights trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of LLM driven test amplification to advance the automation and sustainability of REST API testing in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realistic pedestrian-driver interaction modelling using multi-agent RL with human perceptual-motor constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27383v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or 'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints, two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for simulating realistic road user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolScope: An Agentic Framework for Vision-Guided and Long-Horizon Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27363v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains, including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up to +6.69% across all datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[When AI Trading Agents Compete: Adverse Selection of Meta-Orders by Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27334v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Agent Symmetries for Performance Analysis of Distributed Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11724v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that, in many settings, the worst-case performance of a distributed optimization algorithm is independent of the number of agents in the system, and can thus be computed in the fundamental case with just two agents. This result relies on a novel approach that systematically exploits symmetries in worst-case performance computation, framed as Semidefinite Programming (SDP) via the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework. Harnessing agent symmetries in the PEP yields compact problems whose size is independent of the number of agents in the system. When all agents are equivalent in the problem, we establish the explicit conditions under which the resulting worst-case performance is independent of the number of agents and is therefore equivalent to the basic case with two agents. Our compact PEP formulation also allows the consideration of multiple equivalence classes of agents, and its size only depends on the number of equivalence classes. This enables practical and automated performance analysis of distributed algorithms in numerous complex and realistic settings, such as the analysis of the worst agent performance. We leverage this new tool to analyze the performance of the EXTRA algorithm in advanced settings and its scalability with the number of agents, providing a tighter analysis and deeper understanding of the algorithm performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Open Journal of Mathematical Optimization (OJMO)</p></details> |

While collaborative Digital Twins have been proposed as a solution to manage such systems without compromising the privacy of individual agents, deriving globally optimal control policies from the high-level information they share remains an open problem. This paper introduces Digital Twin Assisted Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DT-MADDPG) algorithm, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a collaborative DT network. Our core contribution is a simulation-assisted learning algorithm where the centralised critic is enhanced by a predictive global model that is collaboratively built from the privacy-preserving data shared by individual DTs. This approach removes the need for collecting sensitive raw data at a centralised entity, a requirement of traditional multi-agent learning algorithms. Experimental results in a simulated V2G environment demonstrate that DT-MADDPG can achieve coordination performance comparable to the standard MADDPG algorithm while offering significant advantages in terms of data privacy and architectural decentralisation. This work presents a practical and robust framework for deploying intelligent, learning-based coordination in complex, real-world cyber-physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

A Sandbox for Evaluating LLM Agents in Enterprise Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27287v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise systems are crucial for enhancing productivity and decision-making among employees and customers. Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth. However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings, featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in enterprise-focused AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

This overview emphasizes the role of AI in the scientific process and the changes brought about, both through technological advancements and the broader evolution of science from around 1950 to the present. Some of the specific points we cover include: the challenges of presenting the first social simulation studies to a world unaware of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics. A pervasive theme is how deeply entwined we are with the technologies we use to understand ourselves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prevalence of Security and Privacy Risk-Inducing Usage of AI-based Conversational Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27275v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent improvement gains in large language models (LLMs) have lead to everyday usage of AI-based Conversational Agents (CAs). At the same time, LLMs are vulnerable to an array of threats, including jailbreaks and, for example, causing remote code execution when fed specific inputs. As a result, users may unintentionally introduce risks, for example, by uploading malicious files or disclosing sensitive information. However, the extent to which such user behaviors occur and thus potentially facilitate exploits remains largely unclear. To shed light on this issue, we surveyed a representative sample of 3,270 UK adults in 2024 using Prolific. A third of these use CA services such as ChatGPT or Gemini at least once a week. Of these ``regular users'', up to a third exhibited behaviors that may enable attacks, and a fourth have tried jailbreaking (often out of understandable reasons such as curiosity, fun or information seeking). Half state that they sanitize data and most participants report not sharing sensitive data. However, few share very sensitive data such as passwords. The majority are unaware that their data can be used to train models and that they can opt-out. Our findings suggest that current academic threat models manifest in the wild, and mitigations or guidelines for the secure usage of CAs should be developed. In areas critical to security and privacy, CAs must be equipped with effective AI guardrails to prevent, for example, revealing sensitive information to curious employees. Vendors need to increase efforts to prevent the entry of sensitive data, and to create transparency with regard to data usage policies and settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, under submission</p></details> |

However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench -- the first comprehensive benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments, covering both explicit and implicit hazards. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 9 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness.

However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos, optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore, the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLM A...</summary><p>LLM Applications, LLM Agents, Financial Technology</p></details> |

This workload creates severe performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake, a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MRAG frameworks primarily adhere to rigid, single-step retrieval strategies that fail to address real-world challenges of information acquisition and query reformulation. In this work, we introduce the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) that aims at effective information seeking and integration while minimizing computational overhead. Specifically, we propose CogPlanner, an agentic plug-and-play framework inspired by human cognitive processes, which iteratively determines query reformulation and retrieval strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. CogPlanner supports parallel and sequential modeling paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the MRAG Planning task and facilitate lightweight CogPlanner integration with resource-efficient MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B-Cog. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner significantly outperforms existing MRAG baselines, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal additional computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

Building on large language models (LLMs) coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed loops. We provide a conceptual and technical overview of agentic AI architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery, including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability, compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates personal medical documents into LLMs by an external retrievable database to address the costly retraining or fine-tuning issues in deploying customized agents. While deploying medical agents in edge devices ensures privacy protection, RAG implementations impose substantial memory access and energy consumption during the retrieval stage. This paper presents a hierarchical retrieval architecture for edge RAG, leveraging a two-stage retrieval scheme that combines approximate retrieval for candidate set generation, followed by high-precision retrieval on pre-selected document embeddings. The proposed architecture significantly reduces energy consumption and external memory access while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Simulation results show that, under TSMC 28nm technology, the proposed hierarchical retrieval architecture has reduced the overall memory access by nearly 50% and the computation by 75% compared to pure INT8 retrieval, and the total energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 {\mu}J/query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BioCAS2025</p></details> |
| **[AVA: Towards Agentic Video Analytics with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254v5)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100.

We present a practical implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors (3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size, and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\% gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel, transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback, navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production. This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

Conversations shared with these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate, privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Big Data 2025</p></details> |

We introduce Sensible Agent, a framework designed for unobtrusive interaction with these proactive agents. Sensible Agent dynamically adapts both "what" assistance to offer and, crucially, "how" to deliver it, based on real-time multimodal context sensing. Informed by an expert workshop (n=12) and a data annotation study (n=40), the framework leverages egocentric cameras, multimodal sensing, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to infer context and suggest appropriate actions delivered via minimally intrusive interaction modes. We demonstrate our prototype on an XR headset through a user study (n=10) in both AR and VR scenarios. Results indicate that Sensible Agent significantly reduces perceived interaction effort compared to voice-prompted baseline, while maintaining high usability and achieving higher preference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Risk Assessments for Offensive Cybersecurity Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18384v5)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

To address these challenges, we propose a distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive, or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots confirm the feasibility of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, to be published in MRS 2025</p></details> |

Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario.

We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding. Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and guiding development toward more effective interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Incentives-Based Framework for Fairness in Multi-agent Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26740v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes. Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem. Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing, homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delegated Authorization for Agents Constrained to Semantic Task-to-Scope Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26702v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper page at https://outshift-open.github.io/ASTRA</p></details> |

However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).</p></details> |  |
| **[The Era of Agentic Organization: Learning to Organize with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26658v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic AI Home Energy Management System: A Large Language Model Framework for Residential Load Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26603v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 9 figures.

In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[CATArena: Evaluation of LLM Agents through Iterative Tournament Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26852v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools. However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate. Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate the broad applicability and robustness of our approach.

However, its application is often hindered by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards, thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}: injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}: employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis, pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.</p></details> |  |

In our setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool. Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were tested for rating the performance of the triage tool. Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78). The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76). Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3 Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522 (0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05). Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Building on the landmark 61-million-person Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano}) reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at https://github.com/CausalMP/LLM-SocioPol}</p></details> |  |
| **[MedAgentBoard: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Collaboration with Conventional Methods for Diverse Medical Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12371v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains.

In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Adaptive Context Length Optimization with Low-Frequency Truncation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26389v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football (GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geometry of Dialogue: Graphing Language Models to Reveal Synergistic Teams for Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26352v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams.</p></details> |  |

In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure, since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign, task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios.

In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline autoregressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over long trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works -- SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo -- covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Empowering RepoQA-Agent based on Reinforcement Learning Driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26287v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models (LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1, we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness across repository-level reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization in LLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26270v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review as a conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Grants the Agent Power? Defending Against Instruction Injection via Task-Centric Access Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26212v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents capable of GUI understanding and Model Context Protocol are increasingly deployed to automate mobile tasks. However, their reliance on over-privileged, static permissions creates a critical vulnerability: instruction injection. Malicious instructions, embedded in otherwise benign content like emails, can hijack the agent to perform unauthorized actions. We present AgentSentry, a lightweight runtime task-centric access control framework that enforces dynamic, task-scoped permissions. Instead of granting broad, persistent permissions, AgentSentry dynamically generates and enforces minimal, temporary policies aligned with the user's specific task (e.g., register for an app), revoking them upon completion. We demonstrate that AgentSentry successfully prevents an instruction injection attack, where an agent is tricked into forwarding private emails, while allowing the legitimate task to complete. Our approach highlights the urgent need for intent-aligned security models to safely govern the next generation of autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>SaTS ...</summary><p>SaTS 2025 (Co-located with ACM CCS 2025)</p></details> |

Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However, discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization. Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA (Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques, SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness. Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Model to Critique Them All: Rewarding Agentic Tool-Use via Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26167v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Dissatisfaction in Bus Route Reduction through LLM-Calibrated Agent-Based Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26163v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As emerging mobility modes continue to expand, many cities face declining bus ridership, increasing fiscal pressure to sustain underutilized routes, and growing inefficiencies in resource allocation. This study employs an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach calibrated through a large language model (LLM) using few-shot learning to examine how progressive bus route cutbacks affect passenger dissatisfaction across demographic groups and overall network resilience. Using IC-card data from Beijing's Huairou District, the LLM-calibrated ABM estimated passenger sensitivity parameters related to travel time, waiting, transfers, and crowding. Results show that the structural configuration of the bus network exerts a stronger influence on system stability than capacity or operational factors. The elimination of high-connectivity routes led to an exponential rise in total dissatisfaction, particularly among passengers with disabilities and older adults. The evolution of dissatisfaction exhibited three distinct phases - stable, transitional, and critical. Through the analysis of each stage, this study found that the continuous bus route reduction scenario exhibits three-stage thresholds. Once these thresholds are crossed, even a small reduction in routes may lead to a significant loss of passenger flow. Research highlights the nonlinear response of user sentiment to service reductions and underscore the importance of maintaining structural critical routes and providing stable services to vulnerable groups for equitable and resilient transport planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

We present FM Agent, a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems. Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research, where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in the FA setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the 16th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom 2025)</p></details> |

However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid obtains a substantial task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 5.2%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves a remarkably low latency of 4.3s per step, which is 6.1x faster compared with existing mobile agents.

However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections (hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 12 figures.

To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
